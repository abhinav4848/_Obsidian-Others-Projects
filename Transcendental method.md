How can we explain a phenomenon we can’t observe? {[[Immanuel Kant]]} proposed that we can {work backwards from observable facts to determine their underlying causes}.

Sometimes also called “inference to best explanation.”

Science employs the transcendental method not just in a passive sense, but actively, by varying the scenario of observation to rule out certain underlying hypotheses or to increase the contrast between two possibilities.
