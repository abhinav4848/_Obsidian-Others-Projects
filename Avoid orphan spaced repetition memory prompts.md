# Avoid orphan spaced repetition memory prompts
When adding prompts to a [[Spaced repetition memory system]], it’s usually a mistake to write prompts about a detail that seems interesting, but which is disconnected from everything else you’re thinking about. [[Spaced repetition memory prompts should connect and relate ideas]]—and it’s even better to make them connect and relate to ideas that you’re regularly thinking about.

“Orphan questions” (coinage per Michael Nielsen, 2018) cause two important problems:

1. After a while, these isolated prompts often start to feel like a burden in the review session, disconnected from what you actually care about (contra [The critical thing to optimize in spaced repetition memory systems is emotional connection to the review session and its contents](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zPiRwRHQxGfF9Zej765PB8M))
2. You’ll likely have more trouble remembering the answers to these questions, since they won’t be naturally reinforced through your daily life. Even if you do remember the answers, there’s a danger that they’ll be pattern-matched because they don’t connect to other knowledge ([Spaced repetition memory prompts should be written to discourage shallow “pattern matching”](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zSiuztCZ594AZuCweRghcXT))

At least for me, one common situation that often results in orphan questions is: someone shares an interesting paper in a field I know nothing about; I read it and write a few prompts. A few months later, I have no idea why I’m reviewing them. They don’t relate to anything I’m doing or thinking about.

Michael underscores the particularly harmful case of “lonely orphans”:

> It’s particularly worth avoiding lonely orphans: single questions that are largely disconnected from everything else. Suppose, for instance, I’m reading an article on a new subject, and I learn an idea that seems particularly useful. I make it a rule to never put in one question. Rather, I try to put at least two questions in, preferably three or more. That’s usually enough that it’s at least the nucleus of a bit of useful knowledge. If it’s a lonely orphan, inevitably I get the question wrong all the time, and it’s a waste to have entered it at all.
