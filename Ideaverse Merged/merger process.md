I have first pasted obsidian lite 1.0, then pasted obsidian pro 1.0 on top of that, then pasted obsidian lite 1.5 on top of that too. 

I have then taken a deduplication software- dupeguru and deleted duplicate copies of files at random, meaning any one of the three copies may be surviving. They all bypassed the merge overwrite dialogue box because they've been moved to different folders over different iterations of the vault by Nick Milo.
