_It's circular but true, we become what we do._

[[Ideaverse Merged/Atlas/Dots/Things/Like begets like]] is the natural process of Evolution's [[Ideaverse Merged/Atlas/Dots/Things/Selfish Gene]].

Because [[Ideaverse Merged/Atlas/Dots/Things/Natural Selection]] demands that organisms become more efficient to increase its chances of survival (see [[Ideaverse Merged/Atlas/Dots/Things/Survival of the Fittest]]).

Said another way, evolution's [[Ideaverse Merged/Atlas/Dots/Things/Selfish Gene]] has a Prime Directive: survive. It this way, Nature is neutral. It grows what you feed it. You are what you eat.

That means whatever you do, whatever tiny action or thought, creates neural pathways; and neural pathways strengthen with use (see: [[Ideaverse Merged/Atlas/Dots/Things/The neural formation of habits is additive]]).

Others: _You are what you eat. I am what I am._

This is a first principle; perhaps one of the most fundamental first principles...one with major ramifications
