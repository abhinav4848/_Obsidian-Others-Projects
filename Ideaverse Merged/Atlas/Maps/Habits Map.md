## Understanding Habits

> [!NOTE]- Use your MOCs for different purposes
> - as a reference point in the future
> - for final products (content creation)
> - for the inherent joy the ideas provide
>
> As you finish work on an area of interest, your MOC remains as a renewable summation of thought for Future You. An MOC is your easy access point back into the topic—whether that's tomorrow or in ten years.

## LYT Vision
Activate "LYT Vision" to resurface thoughts in context. When you twirl this open, it's like you are putting on night vision goggles: you see things hidden in the shadows.

The main contextual queries I prefer are "unrequited" & "unmentioned" notes. 

> [!combo]+ Unrequited notes
> These notes point directly to this note. But this note doesn't point back (yet).
> This is the strongest contextual query.

> ```dataview
> LIST
