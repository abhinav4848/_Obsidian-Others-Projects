 *A concept is a pattern, truth, or mechanism that has been given a name.*
Just like the primordial goop that collided together billions of years ago to spark life on earth, so do these **conceptual** collisions spark exciting and diverse ideas. 

## Daily reminders of powerful concepts
Why not string out these ideas into paragraphs? What a way to unearth hidden connections!

Starting some days, I'll consider how to apply three *strategic* mental models: [[OODA Loop]],  [[Ideaverse Merged/Atlas/Notes/Things/Levels of Magnification|Levels of Magnification]], and [[Ideaverse Merged/Atlas/Notes/Things/Refraction Thinking|Refraction Thinking]]. 

For my work as an editor/AE in TV, I know to improve my craft means the steady application of getting  [[Ideaverse Merged/Atlas/Notes/Things/Reps|Reps]], creating the conditions for [[Ideaverse Merged/Atlas/Dots/Things/Flow]], which involves environmental  [[Ideaverse Merged/Atlas/Dots/Things/Forcing Function|Forcing Functions]], and considering when I can multitask [[Ideaverse Merged/Atlas/Dots/Things/Shadow Clone]].

[[Ideaverse Merged/Atlas/Dots/Things/Natural Selection]] is one of the mega-concepts. It helps me decipher the signal from the noise through the mechanism of considering the [[Ideaverse Merged/Atlas/Dots/Things/Lindy Effect]], along with [[Ideaverse Merged/Atlas/Dots/Things/Hormesis]] and [[Ideaverse Merged/Atlas/Dots/Things/Antifragility]]—and also more broadly [[Ideaverse Merged/Atlas/Dots/Things/Cause and Effect]]. This reminds me of [[Ideaverse Merged/Atlas/Dots/Things/Concept Expansion]].

In times of stress it helps me to broaden my perspective and consider concepts like: [[Ideaverse Merged/Atlas/Dots/Things/Yin and Yang]], [[Ideaverse Merged/Atlas/Dots/Things/Synthesis]], [[Ideaverse Merged/Atlas/Dots/Things/Seasons]], and the [[Ideaverse Merged/Atlas/Dots/Things/Mountain Top Water Drop]]. Dealing with folks in the entertainment industry—and just throughout life really—there are plenty of instances to consider ways to handle ego and aggression. The most fascinating is [[Ideaverse Merged/Atlas/Dots/Things/No-Face]] from Spirited Away, which leads to [[Ideaverse Merged/Atlas/Dots/Things/The Id]]. [[Ideaverse Merged/Atlas/Dots/Things/Aikido]] is good to remember. 

For more avenues to re-expanding my narrowed perspective, try to revisit the [[Ideaverse Merged/Atlas/Dots/Things/Rubik's Cube]], or pull from [[Ideaverse Merged/Atlas/Dots/Things/Munger's Mental Models]].

# LYT Vision
Activate "LYT Vision" to resurface thoughts in context. When you twirl this open, it's like you are putting on night vision goggles: you see things hidden in the shadows.
