ACE is the most universal thinking system to learn, remember, and create.

It is a lot more than just a folder system. ***ACE is really about the head spaces we orient our thoughts around.*** There are three. The table below will help provide perspective. 

| Headspace | Orienting Lens | Intention | Organizing Principle | Underlying Benefit | Guiding Question |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **Atlas** | Knowledge | To Understand | Relatedness / Space | Learn / Remember | _Where would you like to go?_ |
| **Calendar** | Time | To Focus | Time | Remember / Reflect / Plan | _What's on your mind?_ |
| **Efforts** | Action | To Act | Importance | Plan / Create | _What can you work on?_ |

> [!NOTE]+ Test your folder structure slowly
> Do less now. I strongly encourage deferring any "great customizations" for later, and just using the pre-provided ACE framework in the short-term. Why? Because *structure must be earned*, and pre-structuring for an entire day just leads to a fragile building that will break in a week.
