MOCs allow for flexible idea rearrangement because you can map the same bits of information in completely different ways.

Take a second to unpack what's going on here. This highlights a profound but under-appreciated aspect of MOCs. 

> MOCs allow for limitless interpretations. The only limit is your imagination.

Check out (3) extra MOCs below. They all use the exact same 19 concepts, but for different purposes. This type of awesome relational/positional thinking doesn't happen with a rigid table of contents. 

## Concepts by category
These are random categories that I chose because they make sense to me. Yours might be entirely different; and yet we both profit immensely from the exercise.

## Concepts by A-Z sorting
A-Z manual lists are usually a waste of time because they will just become outdated. Just use `#concept` instead.
