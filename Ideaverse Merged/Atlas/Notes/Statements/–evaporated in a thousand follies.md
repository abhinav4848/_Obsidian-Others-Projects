### My notes
Captivity, compression, collision... concentration, density, tightly-packed

light, spark, explode, electricity, lightning, illumination

> The tightly-packed collision of clouds produces intense electricity in the form of lightning; and from lightning comes illumination. The same is true for ideas. 

I mash up this concept from [[Alexandre Dumas]] with the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland in my LYT workshop lesson focused on [[Ideaverse Merged/Atlas/Dots/Things/Thought Collisions]].
