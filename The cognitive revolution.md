By {the mid twentieth century}, many scholars had pointed out the limitations of [[Behaviorism]]: behavior depends on {non-observable internal phenomena} like {memories and beliefs}, which behaviorists exclude from their experimental methods because {they’re subjective}.

Psychologists began to study these internal phenomena using the [[Transcendental method]] and ideas borrowed from computer science, eventually producing the field of [[Cognitive psychology]] and the theoretical framework of [[Cognitivism]].

## Key factors precipitating the cognitive revolution

{Edward Tolman}’s 1948 rat experiments demonstrated the role of {knowledge} in behavior by {letting rats explore a maze for several days}, then testing them by {placing food in the maze}. He observed that {the rats were able to immediately find the food in the maze}, which suggests that they’d acquired a “{cognitive map}”. This contradicts [[Behaviorism]]’s theory that learning can be understood as {a change in behavior}.

[[B. F. Skinner]]’s _Verbal Behavior_ (1957) claimed that language could be learned through {[[Operant conditioning]]}. {[[Noam Chomsky]]} published a scathing review, pointing out that {children produce speech they’ve never heard or been rewarded for}.

[[Frederic Bartlett]]’s experiments suggested that people interpret their experiences through mental frameworks he called “schemas.”

Computing technology inspired a wave of new psychological theories using information processing metaphors: buffers, gates, processing events, etc.

Q. What’s the significance of the [[Transcendental method]] to [[Cognitive psychology]]?  
A. It resolved an important paradox: understanding behavior requires understanding internal phenomena, which can’t be directly observed.
