# The mnemonic medium can generate interesting author analytics
If you publish something in the [[Mnemonic medium]], you get to know not only how many people loaded the page, as usual, but also information about how people engaged with the prompts on the page. Some potential applications:

- you can estimate the distribution of where people stop reading, assuming they’re reading linearly; and for less linear pieces, you can estimate the distribution of the sections people value
- you can see how long people continue to review your prompts after reading your essay, and how many people have internalized it to various levels ([[The mnemonic medium can surface “proof of memory” social signals]])
- prompt-specific data:
    - which prompts people have trouble remembering
    - which prompts people tend to re-word, skip, or disable
