# Conversations incorporating multiple discussants’ evergreen notes may promote collaborative sense-making
[[Evergreen notes can increase conversational bandwidth]], but something particularly interesting happens when multiple people have written [[Evergreen notes]] related to a single discussion topic. Instead of figuratively “comparing notes” on an idea conversationally, the discussants can _literally_ compare notes around some idea. Each person will have factored their notes somewhat differently, so it usually won’t be possible to make a 1:1 correspondence—and that’s the whole point. Each person will approach the idea from a different angle, notice different implications, frame it within different contexts.

The instinct, then, is to actually connect the systems, but [[Collaborative knowledge management systems tend to decay]].

This is mostly a theoretical observation: I haven’t had enough conversations like this to really understand them.
