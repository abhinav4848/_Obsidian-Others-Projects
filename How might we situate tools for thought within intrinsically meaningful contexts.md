# How might we situate tools for thought within intrinsically meaningful contexts?

[[Explorable explanations]] and the [[Mnemonic medium]] are cool, but interactive articles and spaced repetition practice are miles away from where the actual meaning is. [[Enabling environments focus on creating opportunities for growth and action, not on skill-building]]. How might we adapt these types of powerful tools so that they can be situated within deeply meaningful interactions?

What if “practice sessions” for a [[Spaced repetition memory system]] could be excised completely, instead structuring one’s authentic environment so that “practice” naturally occurs through daily actions? e.g. [[Twitter is a kind of programmable attention]]; [[Evergreen note maintenance approximates spaced repetition]]. Related: [[The dominant culture around spaced repetition memory systems is fixated on meaningless goals]].

What if abstract articles about topics could be brought into the social environment which gives them meaning? [[Connecting prose and its surrounding Twitter conversation]]

What if “learning environments” were intrinsically embedded in their context of use? e.g. [The Primer++ is embedded in a field, bootstrapping participation through enacted experience](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zP7xzHHLs9rLZudGvGjmD9k); [[2021-10-31 Patreon post- Doing-centric explanatory mediums- board game instruction manuals, and an unusual Figma document|2021-10-31 Patreon post - Doing-centric explanatory mediums: board game instruction manuals, and an unusual Figma document]];
