A (1998) monograph on a theory for a [[Cognitive psychology]] model for comprehension, mostly in the context of [[Reading comprehension]].

I’ve just done [Inspectional reading](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zTqMd4acQkC6dmrigEhWoE) so far. Chapter 8 (on long-term short-term memory) seems particularly interesting and relevant to my work. The rest is probably a notch too low-level for my purposes, though it looks very interesting. Chapter 9 is quite relevant, too: it tries to provide a more mechanistic definition of deep and shallow understanding.
