###  [The Power of Archiving and Memory in Research](https://share.snipd.com/snip/27649fce-95d3-4b6f-bff6-c5e2165cc6f3) 

🎧 10:43 - 12:05 (01:22)

1. The speaker avidly reads journals in various fields of study, such as psychology, sociology, economics, and anthropology.
2. They have an efficient method of archiving interesting articles they come across, allowing them to retrieve them easily.
3. Despite having a poor memory for many things, the speaker has a remarkable memory for research studies published many years ago.
4. Their ability to recall past studies helps them identify patterns and recognize prolific researchers in specific areas.
5. They actively consider incorporating noteworthy research into their podcast episodes.

#### 📚 Transcript

So i'm reading journals in in psychology and sociology and economics and anthropology. I read very, very voraciously. And i also try and keep track of interesting articles that i come by. So for the past, i would say, 15 years or so, every time i come by an interesting article, i save the article, and then i have an internal sort of archiving system that allows me to go back and retrieve the article with a bunch of keywords that i have set up. So i'm able to find those articles even if something came up, you know, five, six, seven, eight, ten years ago. And and it's interesting to him that i have a really terrible memory when it comes to almost everything. I have a very bad memory for faces and names. I forget what i did yesterday. If you asked me what i ate for lunch yesterday, i have absolutely no recollection of it. But for some reason, i have an excellent memory for research studies that were published many years ago. And this is, this has stood us in good stead, because i'm often able to see patterns that come up. Eh, just a couple of weeks ago, for example, i was a mentioning to a colleague that i've come by the work of a researcher in chicago. And i've come by his work multiple times in the past, you know, 18 months or so. And once i start to see that, that tells me there's something interesting happening here. This person is publishing is really prolific in this area. Let me pay attention to it, i start thinking about ways in which that work can become a hidden brain episode, as you say, a ino multiple times.

#### 📚 Transcript

Yes, i i won't get into all ther details because i want listeners to listen to this episode. This is an episode that, in fact, we've been working on for, i would say, almost two years at this point. And that's the other interesting thing about hidden brain episodes, which is of them come together in three weeks, and some of them take months or even years to put together. But this is a a really unusual story about a man who had e two dreams. Aand of course, the dreams were just strange dreams, like all dreams are, and he dismissed them a except that one of the dreams, a purportedt tell him how long he was going to live. Ah, and he had these dreams when he was a teen ager. And then he put the dreams out of his mind. And then what happened is, some years later, the first dream that he had that night, which was also a bizarre dream, came true in almost every way, shape and form. And it made him start to ask himself, is itss that i was told something that night about my future? And is it possible that the second dream, which purported to tell me how long i was going to live, is also going to come true? And he reached out to hidden brain shortly before the birthday where inno his his his dream had forecast that he was going to die, asking us how to think about about think about these dreams. And of course, it's a fascinating story from a psychological point of view, because it raises really interesting questions about how we think about our own mortality, how we think about predictions, how we think about prognostications. You know, how we think about patterns in terms of the things that occur to us the brain. The brain is a patternreco an machine, as as many listeners of your show i'm sure are aware of. But how does this affect us in terms of our daily behaviour?
