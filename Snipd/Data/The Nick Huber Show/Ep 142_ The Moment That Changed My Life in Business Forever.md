###  [Negotiating Equity in Business: The Power of Realism and Respect](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0ce20af4-d68f-4bfe-98f7-277373454048) 

🎧 03:40 - 05:19 (01:39)

Approaching a business for equity requires a realistic and respectful mindset. Instead of demanding equity as a gift, presenting all facts, growth, and options lays the foundation for a successful negotiation. By stating the value brought and proposing to purchase equity with a small check, it shifts the conversation to a collaborative tone. Demonstrating understanding and respect for the business owners' value, even without leverage, can lead to a mutually beneficial deal and a maintained positive relationship.

#### 📚 Transcript

So I went to Marshall in April of 2022, one year later. And I was like, Marshall, I need equity or I'm going to go start a competitor. Right. I was doing the same for a cost-set guy. I had a cost segregation guy who I was talking about in his business group from 300 to a million dollars a year of revenue. Yeah. And he was sending me 15 or 20 grand a month. So I was making $800,000, 500 grand a year, 40 grand a month, 500 grand a year as an affiliate for these two businesses. I went to both of them at the same time. Well, Marshall first and said, look, I need equity in this business. And we made a deal where I bought some equity and I was a 15% shareholder in support shepherd. Yeah.

One really quick thing. A lot of people come into that scenario and they say, I need equity, give me equity. Very adversarial. And then they say the equity should be a gift. And I think what's smart, you came in very realistic. You know, here's all the facts, here's the business grown. Here are all of my options. Like all cards on the table. Yeah. Like I've realized the value of this. I basically told

them we need to make a deal where I can get some very cheap equity. Yeah. I'm going to write you a small check and I need equity in this business or I'm going to go start my own. No hard feelings. Your life has changed for the better because of me. Yeah. My life has changed for the better because you, we will remain friends. Yeah. But I'm going to start this business unless you get me in on this business.

But then also coming in and saying I will buy in. Yeah. I think it's really important because it changes the tone of that conversation. Yeah. Because it shows that you understand the value of what they own. Yeah. And like it shows a good amount of respect. I had no leverage too. Yeah. So okay. So you did that on the Shepherd's side.
