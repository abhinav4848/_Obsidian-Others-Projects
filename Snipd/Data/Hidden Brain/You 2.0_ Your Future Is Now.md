###  [Ulessys pact against siren song](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2d27c559-936b-424c-bc06-e815b3cec0f1) 

🎧 00:05 - 02:01 (01:56)

- In Greek mythology, Ulysses wanted to hear the sirens' song but feared losing control.
- He had his men tie him to the ship's mast to resist temptation.
- This concept is used in 'Ulysses Pacts' where people pre-commit to avoid future mistakes.
- Examples include assigning power of attorney or avoiding buying junk food.

#### 💬 Quote

> When you skip buying chips and soda [...] because you worry you will give into temptation if you keep junk food at home, you are crafting a soft version of a Ulysses pact with yourself.
> — Shankar Vedantam

Shankar Vedantam giving examples of Ulysses pacts.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Shankar Vedantam:** Greek mythology, the sirens were alluring sea creatures who sang beautiful and beguiling songs. Sailors lured by these sirens found themselves running aground on rocks and capsizing. It's the origin of the phrase, siren song, to describe a temptation that conceals danger. According to Greek mythology, the warrior Ulysses wanted to hear the song of the sirens, but feared he would lose control of his faculties and run his ship aground. So he had his men bind him to the mast of his own ship. When he heard the song of the sirens, the ropes constrained him from giving in to temptations. In modern times, social scientists and lawyers design what are sometimes known as Ulysses Pacts or Ulysses Contracts. Exactly as in the myth, these are ways you can limit what you yourself can do in the future if you feel you are likely to make mistakes. If you fear you are at risk for dementia, for example, you can sign over power of attorney to a relative to keep yourself from making poor decisions in the years to come. States and nations sometimes pass laws to constrain themselves from overspending future budgets. When you skip buying chips and soda at the grocery store because you worry you will give into temptation if you keep junk food at home, you are crafting a soft version of a Ulysses pact with yourself. You are constraining what you will do in the future. Today,

🎧 07:19 - 07:59 (00:40)

- We tend to prioritize immediate rewards over future benefits, a concept called temporal discounting.
- We often choose present gratification even if it leads to future suffering.
- This tendency can be observed in various areas such as spending vs. saving, exercising vs. inactivity, or healthy eating vs. overeating.

#### 💬 Quote

> Economists and psychologists call this temporal discounting, is a fancy term to basically say that we discount the value of future rewards relative to present ones.

Hal Hershfield explaining the concept of temporal discounting.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Shankar Vedantam:** across all of human nature. Yeah,

**Hal Hershfield:** that's right. Economists and psychologists call this temporal discounting, is a fancy term to basically say that we discount the value of future rewards relative to present ones. So if I have an option for something right now and I can get it, but I may end up suffering later on, I may be oriented to just say, yeah, I'll go for it. You know, you can see this when it comes to, you know, overspending versus saving or exercising versus sitting on the couch and overeating versus eating, you know, a healthier, more modest portion. These sorts

🎧 09:10 - 10:48 (01:37)

- Hal Hershfield procrastinated on changing his neuroanatomy class to pass/fail, assuming he'd remember.
- Despite studying and wanting to prioritize time, he forgot to submit the request.
- He realized his mistake after the exam, but the registrar couldn't change it due to a strict policy.
- As a result, he received a poor letter grade instead of a pass.

#### 💬 Quote

> I kept sort of pushing it off. And then the end of the quarter came [...] I said, OK, well, I'm taking the class pass fail. I will study for it because I want to pass, but I'm not going to study for it to such a degree that I will necessarily, you know, get an A.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Hal Hershfield:** off. And then the end of the quarter came and there was going to be this really intense final exam. And I said, OK, well, I'm taking the class pass fail. I will study for it because I want to pass, but I'm not going to study for it to such a degree that I will necessarily, you know, get an A. I want it to be sort of mindful of my time. So I study, study, study. I take the exam. And I have this distinct memory where it's the day that I've taken the exam. I think we might have gone out to dinner that night. I go to bed. I wake up in the middle of the night and I have this sudden question hanging over me, which is, oh my gosh, did I remember to switch the pass fail? And I check the next morning. And sure enough, I am still signed up for a letter grade. Well, you know, I didn't even know the grade I got, but I emailed the professor. I said, please, I meant to do this. I meant to make a pass fail. And he said, there's nothing I can do, but the registrar is in control here. And I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll never forget the registrar's name because it was the most perfect name is Roger printup, which, you know, for someone who deals with paperwork all day. And I, you know, send this desperate plea to him and to his credit, he writes back and says, this is a very difficult case, but we have a hard and fast rule of not changing the letter grade versus pass fail status after the deadline. Hal scraped

**Shankar Vedantam:** through, but got a terrible grain. His procrastination when it came to filing the request with the registrar had cost him dearly.

🎧 09:59 - 11:27 (01:27)

- Hal Hershfield procrastinated on changing a neuroanatomy class to pass/fail, assuming his future self would handle it. 
- He ended up studying for the exam without changing the grading status. 
- After realizing his mistake, the registrar refused to change it due to a strict policy, resulting in a poor grade. 
- This highlights how we sometimes imagine our future selves will act differently, leading to negative consequences.

**Hal Hershfield:** Well, you know, I didn't even know the grade I got, but I emailed the professor. I said, please, I meant to do this. I meant to make a pass fail. And he said, there's nothing I can do, but the registrar is in control here.

Hal scraped

**Shankar Vedantam:** through, but got a terrible grain. His procrastination when it came to filing the request with the registrar had cost him dearly.

**Hal Hershfield:** Looking

**Shankar Vedantam:** back, Hal thinks this example illustrates one way in which we fail to do well by our future selves. We imagine our future selves will be different from our current selves in some convenient way. Hal told himself, I'm busy, so I'll put off this chore until tomorrow. Of course, when the next day rolled around, Hal was just as busy. Another way we do a disservice to our future cells is that we prioritize the concerns of the present and disregard the consequences. Hal cites another

###  [Unhealthy Food Choices](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d3851a8e-e04f-4da8-897f-3c1d08432172) 

🎧 11:59 - 13:21 (01:22)

- Hal Hershfield prioritized convenience over health while living in New York, frequently buying unhealthy prepared meals from a store near his office.
- This continued for a while until his annual physical, where his doctor told him he needed statins for high cholesterol in his early 30s.
- He hadn't considered the cumulative effect of his daily food choices on his long-term health.

Hal Hershfield on his unhealthy eating habits.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Hal Hershfield:** Now, where I lived in the city, there were lots of these little sort of convenience stores, which also had sort of hot prepared food in the back of the store. And there was one right across from my office. And I would go in there and sort of load up and it was, you know, by weight. And I sort of said, ah, I'm just going to get as much as I can. Looking back, I can't say it was the healthiest stuff. And this was my routine for a while. And then I went in for my annual physical. And I was in my early 30s at the time. I went in for my annual physical. And my doctor said, you know, I looked at your numbers and I think it's time we put you on statins for your very high cholesterol. And I said,

**Shankar Vedantam:** wait, what? What? But on each given day when you were busy, it did make sense in some ways to basically say, I'm busy, I'm hungry, I'm just going to pick up some food, I'm not going to think about it. And of course, what you're not doing in that moment is asking what's going to happen six months from now when I'm in the doctor's office. Yeah,

**Hal Hershfield:** in a way, it was as if I was separating out each present day from the days that followed. I can do this. Looking back, it was almost as if I didn't see how all those different meals and all those different days could add up to create a much more problematic hole.

🎧 15:20 - 15:33 (00:13)

- People acknowledge personal change from the past to the present.
- However, they underestimate future change, believing their current state is largely permanent.
- This 'end of history illusion' leads individuals to wrongly assume their values, preferences, and perspectives will remain static.

#### 💬 Quote

> It's one of my favorite sort of psychological effects. They call it the end of history illusion. And it's essentially suggesting that we recognize that we've changed from the past to the present. And although we assume that we will change a little bit from now to the future, we think that [...] the rate of progress somehow will slow down.

🎧 16:27 - 17:59 (01:32)

- Humans struggle to make good choices for their future selves, from Greek mythology to modern-day financial crises.
- We often misattribute bad decisions to short-sightedness or succumbing to temptation.
- The podcast explores a more nuanced reason for these failures and offers strategies for improvement.

Shankar Vedantam on why we make bad decisions.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Shankar Vedantam:** When we make bad decisions, we often assume that we are being short-sighted or giving in too easily to temptations. When we come back, Hal discovers a much more interesting reason why many of us fail to do right by our future selves and how we can do better. You're listening to Hidden Brain. I'm Shankar Vedantam.

###  [Future Self as a Stranger](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e63ac2cc-8a69-47be-aef6-3f07c8e752a2) 

🎧 19:27 - 19:54 (00:27)

- While we conceptually understand our future selves as extensions of ourselves, brain scans suggest otherwise.
- fMRI studies indicate that brain activity patterns when contemplating our future selves resemble those when thinking about other people.
- This suggests a disconnect between our conscious understanding and subconscious processing of our future identities.
- This disconnect can explain why it's challenging to make decisions benefiting our future selves, as they feel like different people.

#### 💬 Quote

> So that's interesting because, of course, at an intuitive level, all of us imagined that the people we're going to be in 30 years, we're still going to say, I'm still going to be Shankar and you're still going to be Hal. But you're saying in the brain, they seem so distant and so far away from us that they seem like literally like different people.

But you're saying in the brain, they seem so distant and so far away from us that they seem like literally like different people.

**Hal Hershfield:** Yeah, I think on the surface, if you were to ask people, you know, will you still be you? And are you still the same you as you were when you were eight or nine? I think on the surface, yeah, yeah, I'm still Hal. I still have my same first name.

- People often perceive their future selves as distinct from their present selves.
- Brain activity suggests that thinking about our future selves resembles thinking about other people.
- This disconnect can explain why individuals sometimes engage in short-sighted behaviors that don't benefit their future selves.

Hal Hershfield discussing how people perceive their future selves

#### 📚 Transcript

**Hal Hershfield:** Your preferences, your likes, your dislikes, these things may change as well. And so on some level, it may be understandable that our future selves look almost as if they are other people.

**Shankar Vedantam:** So other lines of research have confirmed this finding. Tell me about the study conducted by Emily Pronin and Lee Ross.

**Hal Hershfield:** So Emily Pronin and Lee Ross did this really interesting study where they went to college students and they had them write about a meal that they were currently eating. And when they did so, they were likely to sort of describe it as the meal was laid out in front of them. They were likely to use the first person perspective. Now, they had a different group of college students write about a meal that they would eat in the very distant future, which to college students is like somewhere over the age of 40, I believe. And this group of students was considerably more likely to adopt the third-person perspective. That is, they would see their future self as if it was another person in the scene. It was almost as if they were using an observer's perspective.

**Shankar Vedantam:** So it's almost as if when people act in short-sighted ways, when they fail to plan ahead, you know, we conclude they are poor planners or lack self-control, but your research and this work by Emily and by Lee almost seems to be hinting at a different

- People relate to their future selves as if they were other people.

**Hal Hershfield:** I think if we start to think about how we relate to our future selves as if they're other people, then it can start to shed some light why we sometimes act in these ways that may seem short-sighted. I mean, think about it this way. How do we treat strangers in our lives, right? If a stranger or, you know what, even if a coworker who I barely know, if they came up to me and asked me for help, I don't know, moving this weekend, I'd probably come up with a lot of reasons

- If you feel more connected to your future self, you'll be less likely to discount the importance of your future.
- Treat your future self like a close friend or family member.
- If you feel emotionally connected to your future self, you'll be more likely to make decisions that benefit both your present and future.
- This involves injecting empathy and a sense of connection with your future self.

Shankar Vedantam on the importance of connecting with your future self.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Shankar Vedantam:** So what I find really interesting about what you said, Hal, is that it suggests that if we could build a warmer and closer relationship with our future selves, if we come to think of our future selves the way we think about, you know, a beloved child or a spouse or a close friend, we might have a very different relationship to what we're doing in the here and now. That's

**Hal Hershfield:** right. It's really, in some ways, about injecting a sense of empathy into the relationships that we have with these distant versions of ourselves. more of this sense of connection, more of a feeling of overlap with their future selves, are more likely to engage in these sorts of behaviors that will benefit them over time, but both now and in the future. One

**Shankar Vedantam:** of the really interesting and practical ways that you have found that we can build a warmer, closer relationship with our future self has to do with photography. What is the idea, Hal? So early

**Hal Hershfield:** on, my collaborators and I were trying to figure out, well, how do we get people to feel more of a sense of connection to their own future selves? It's not an easy thing to do. It's almost like saying, how can I get you to feel more of a sense of connection to someone you don't really know? Here's one thing we do know. If I can make some sort of target person more vivid and more emotional, say the recipient of charity, well, then you're going to be more likely to make a donation, right?

- To encourage behaviors benefiting your future self, increase empathy and connection with that future version of you.
- Make the future self more vivid and emotional, like you would to encourage donations to a charitable cause.
- One method is using age-progressed images, which studies show increase intentions to save for the long term.

**Shankar Vedantam:** What is the idea, Hal? So early

**Hal Hershfield:** on, my collaborators and I were trying to figure out, well, how do we get people to feel more of a sense of connection to their own future selves? It's not an easy thing to do. It's almost like saying, how can I get you to feel more of a sense of connection to someone you don't really know? Here's one thing we do know. If I can make some sort of target person more vivid and more emotional, say the recipient of charity, well, then you're going to be more likely to make a donation, right? And so, you know, we wanted to show people what they might look like in the future. And so, you know, one of our studies, we put people into a virtual reality room, in fact, and they had these goggles on and they would walk around the room and they would come face to face with a virtual mirror. then staring back at them in that virtual mirror was either a digitally altered image of their future self or a digital image of their current self. Now, in that, you know, first sort of foray at this, we found that the people who were exposed to these age-progressed images intended to save more for the long run. They said they wanted to save more. So

**Shankar Vedantam:** in some ways, making the future self more vivid, more clear, is one way to build a closer relationship with the future self.

**Hal Hershfield:** That's exactly right. Part of what we're trying to do here is really sort of turn up the dial on identifiability and vividness. If I can get you to really vividly think about your future self, and I can get you to identify with that person, well, now all of a sudden it's much easier to start saying, you know, the things that I'm doing right now are going to impact not just some sort of perfectly abstract stranger, but somebody

- Viewing age-progressed images can encourage positive behaviors.
- A study by Tamara Sims showed that community college students exposed to these images increased their motivation to learn about finances and improved their financial literacy.
- Similar research suggests that age-progressed images can also motivate people to exercise more regularly.

**Shankar Vedantam:** So you and other researchers have found that viewing age-progressed images can have other salutary effects as well. The behavioral scientist Tamara Sims showed age-progressed images to a group of community college students. What was

**Hal Hershfield:** the result, Hal? Sure. So Tamara Sims and her collaborators, they did this really interesting study where they worked with community college students. This was over a semester-long course. And every few weeks, the students would be shown an image while they were, you know, doing these sort of check-in surveys. And half of them got these digitally altered images. was just a picture of their current self that sort of digitized. The other half got age-progressed images. And what Tamara and her collaborators found was that by the end of the semester, the students who were shown the age progressed images had a higher motivation to learn about finances. And they also showed higher scores on financial knowledge or what researchers call financial literacy, they start understanding the concepts of financial decisions a little bit better.

**Shankar Vedantam:** I'm wondering if the same idea can be used to help people exercise more. So for example, if I think of myself as being an older person and perhaps a little more frail, could that motivate me to do a few more healthy things today so that I can have, you know, so that I can be fitter as I get older? Yeah,

**Hal Hershfield:** I mean, there is some other work.

- To enhance your connection with your future self, try writing letters.
- Some research suggests that having conversations with your future self can strengthen your bond with them.
- For example, high school students who wrote letters to and from their future selves felt a greater sense of connection and continuity.
- This exercise encourages you to see the world from your future self's perspective and understand their feelings.
- Engaging in this back-and-forth exchange is more effective than simply writing a one-way letter to your future self.

**Shankar Vedantam:** So far, we've looked at different ways in which you can make your future self more vivid. The more we interact with our future self as an extension of ourselves, the better decisions we can make. Researchers have found another method for increasing our sense of closeness to our future selves, writing letters. Some

**Hal Hershfield:** work has found that if we engage in these sorts of conversations with our future selves, it can really enhance the bond that we have with them. So Anne Wilson and Yuda Shashima, for instance, had high school students write a letter to their future selves, but then also write a letter back from their future selves. And they found that that exercise, that conversation really dialed up the sense of connection and, quote unquote, continuity that these students felt with their future selves.

###  [Mitigating the One-Sided Relationship with Our Future Selves](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3337259e-1bc1-4a08-9176-6eb1613c13d2)

- Our relationship with our future selves can feel one-sided, with us making sacrifices for them but not vice-versa. 
- To lessen the pain of present sacrifices, adjust how we frame them. 
- Reframing sacrifices into smaller units can make them feel psychologically easier. 
- Hal Hershfield, along with Sholmo Benartzi and Steve Hsu, explored this in a project involving the savings app Acorns.

**Shankar Vedantam:** Our future selves don't grow into us. But one way to mitigate the sense that this is a one-way relationship is to reduce the pain we feel when we make sacrifices in the present for our future cells. You say that we should pay attention to the language we use by breaking sacrifices into smaller units. Give me an example of how this works.

**Hal Hershfield:** So you're absolutely right. You know, in some ways, this relationship, it's like a bad relationship where you're always sacrificing for your partner and they're doing nothing for you. So you're right. Part of the job here is to figure out how do we make those present day sacrifices feel psychologically easier to undertake. And I think the framing of them matters here. So in one project that I conducted with Sholmo Benartzi and Steve Hsu, we

- Frame savings goals in smaller units to make them feel less daunting.
- Instead of presenting a large monthly amount, break it down into a smaller daily amount.
- This psychological reframing can significantly increase the likelihood of people committing to saving.

Hal Hershfield on framing savings goals.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Hal Hershfield:** So you're right. Part of the job here is to figure out how do we make those present day sacrifices feel psychologically easier to undertake. And I think the framing of them matters here. So in one project that I conducted with Sholmo Benartzi and Steve Hsu, we worked with a fintech company as a savings app, Acorns. And everybody who signs up during this period of time that we were running this project are given the opportunity to sign up for an automatic savings account. Now, for some of them, we ask, do you want to sign up for the savings account? It's 150 bucks a month that you can save. It'll come out every month. Now, another group, we ask if you want to save five bucks a day. Oh, now, you know, this is the same exact amount,

**Shankar Vedantam:** right? Right. Five bucks a day times 30 days is 150 bucks a month.

**Hal Hershfield:** Exactly. Exactly. If anything, by the way, annually, you know, because there's different days in the month annually, it's five bucks a day is a little bit more. But what's interesting about this from my perspective is that it's the same thing, but $5 a day, it just feels a little bit easier. It doesn't feel like such a big sacrifice. I know that it can be for some people, but for a lot of people, it's relatively easy to think about something I'll give up that's $5 a day. It's a lot harder to think about something that I spent $150 a month on and giving that up. It's like there's only a few things that fall into that

- Hal Hershfield's friend, Craig, worked with a nutritionist who asked him to send photos of all his meals.
- Craig wasn't usually one to document his food, but he complied with the nutritionist's request.
- This simple act of taking pictures made him more accountable for his food choices.
- He felt he didn't want to disappoint the nutritionist by sending pictures of unhealthy meals, even though she might not have been looking at them.
- This accountability helped him make healthier choices.

**Hal Hershfield:** of my friends, I remember this really well because he's not one of those folks who takes pictures of his food. I'm sure everybody has those people in their lives. And my friend Craig is like, just not that guy. And one day I was at lunch with him and I noticed him taking pictures of his food. And I thought, what's going on here? By the way, it wasn't like a particularly beautiful meal. It just like a sandwich from the work, you know, the little cafe here. And he said, oh, you know, I'm working with this nutritionist and she has me sending photos of everything that I'm eating. And, you know, one of the things that he had said to me, it's really funny. He felt like he didn't want to sort of mess up and eat something unhealthy because he didn't want to let down this person. By the way, she didn't even live in the U.S. It's not like she could hold any sway over him. And probably even looking at the pictures. Yeah, exactly, right? But, you know, I do remember that one day I said, there's a bag of peanuts on your lap there. You know, he said, oh, oh, oh, I forgot. I meant to put that...

**Shankar Vedantam:** Some cheating might actually help us keep our resolutions. There's research on that front, too. Exactly.

- To strengthen commitments, add consequences for not following through.
- Pit the desire to avoid loss against the desire to give in to temptation.
- People who add a punishment for breaking commitments are four times more likely to stick with them.
- Consider platforms like Stickk.com, which facilitate commitment contracts with penalties.

Hal Hershfield on using punishments to reinforce commitments.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Hal Hershfield:** That can be hard to do.

**Shankar Vedantam:** You know, in an early episode of Hidden Brain, Hal, I was trying to get a colleague of mine to quit smoking. And so I asked him to make a commitment to quit and added a very painful punishment, which is if he started smoking again, he would have to donate money to an organization he detested. And this idea, of course, came from the platform stick.com. It's spelled S-T dot com, which helps people stay bound to their commitments. What does the data show about the effectiveness of programs like STIC?

**Hal Hershfield:** Yeah, so recent research led by Craig Brimhall has found that people who sign up with a punishment attached, and you don't have to add a punishment, but if you do, the people who add in the punishment are four times as likely to follow through with their commitments compared to the people who don't add that punishment in. That's

**Shankar Vedantam:** remarkable. Yeah.

**Hal Hershfield:** I mean, it is remarkable and it makes sense because I really don't want to lose out. And I don't want to suffer the punishment, especially when I know that the person who deserves the blame is essentially me.

**Shankar Vedantam:** So we've talked at length today, Hal, about ways in which we can avoid prioritizing our present selves over our future selves. But some of us can also tip over in the other direction and start to prioritize our future selves over our present selves exclusively.
