**Adam Alter:** him might have something to learn from an

**Shankar Vedantam:** experiment conducted many years ago by the psychologist Clark Hull. What makes this experiment unusual is that the test subjects were mice?

**Adam Alter:** Yeah, that's right. Hull was a behaviorist, and a lot of behaviorists in that period in the middle of the 20th century studied mice because they were very easy to study. They were very interested in some very basic psychological principles that applied to mice just as they did to humans. And so Hull used to create mazes for his mice, and he would watch as they completed these mazes. What

**Shankar Vedantam:** do mice running through a maze have to do with a writer of epic fantasy novels getting

**Adam Alter:** stuck? The thing that he noticed most was that the mice, when they first entered the maze, were quite slow to move. They were puzzled by the situation that faced them. But as the goal, whatever the goal was, whether it was a piece of food or whether it was exiting the maze, as the goal came into view, they moved much more quickly. And he described this as the goal gradient. It's the idea that, at least subjectively, it feels to mice and actually to humans as well, as though, as you can see the goal in sight, that the experience becomes almost metaphorically downhill. It's much easier to bridge the gap between where you are and where you'd like to be. And

**Adam Alter:** similar. If you're writing something large like a thesis or a book or an article, there are different ways to construe that goal. Now, obviously, if you zoom back far enough, the goal is to finish the book or finish the article, but that's overwhelming in the same way that sailing a ship across the ocean might be overwhelming. And so you might have this stuck in the middle experience, which I think a lot of people do. The nice thing about writing a book is it's broken naturally into chapters. So already you've shrunk those middles down. Let's say there are 12 chapters in a book that you're writing. You've taken that large goal and you've made sure that the middle is smaller by having these 12 sub goals that fall under that larger umbrella. But even within a chapter, people will say every 100 words is my goal. And I've often used that tactic, especially as the process of writing becomes difficult or when you're entering a difficult part of a story or a study that you're trying to describe. What I find is that the goal for me shrinks as I am struggling more, as I become more stuck, and it grows again as the process of writing feels a bit easier. And I find that shrinking and expanding happens constantly as I'm writing the book.

**Shankar Vedantam:** I understand that you sometimes set the timer on your watch for 60 seconds and aim to write until the timer goes off. Why would you set a timer to write for only one minute?

**Adam Alter:** Yeah, these are the

**Shankar Vedantam:** This Hidden Brain. I'm Shankar Vedantam. Adam Alter. a psychologist at New York University. He has studied why we get stuck and how we can get ourselves unstuck. One thing he and others have found is that many of the obstacles that stand between us and our goals are created by us. Adam, in your book, Anatomy of a Breakthrough, you illustrate one of these obstacles with a story about a musician. I want to play you a clip of a song. We're strangers, however close we get sometimes. It's like we never met, but you and I, I think we can take it. Adam, tell me Jeff Tweedy's story and

**Adam Alter:** the trap he once constructed for himself. So Tweedy is the front man of the band Wilco, and he's

**Adam Alter:** a bit of a Renaissance man. He writes music, but he also writes books. And he has described quite vividly his own experiences with writer's block in both contexts, and talked quite a

**Shankar Vedantam:** lot about how he's managed to unstick himself over time. One problem that Jeff Tweedy has battled will be familiar to many people. Perfectionism. Perfectionism

**Adam Alter:** is paralyzing because what it basically does is it signals to you that unless you're producing perfection, you're failing. And so the feedback that you're getting constantly, since most of us aren't perfect most of the time, is negative feedback. And it's demotivating. And it also means that when you ask yourself at the end of a period, whether it's a few hours or at the end of the day, whether you've produced anything, because perfectionism is essentially binary, the feedback you get is that you have failed most days or many days. And so people like Tweety, who have created this trap for themselves, find that it's very, very hard to be motivated across time. And so the products they create are few and far between, and then they often feel quite negative about what they've created.

**Shankar Vedantam:** So you say that Jeff Tweedy has come up with an ingenious way of battling this challenge. What does he do? Yeah, he has this great description.

**Adam Alter:** This term, he says he pours out the bad material. So the way he thinks about it, and I think this is true of a lot of creative enterprises,

**Shankar Vedantam:** goal pursuit in moral terms. What do you mean by this, Adam?

**Adam Alter:** Yeah, I think people who

**Shankar Vedantam:** succeed seem in

**Adam Alter:** some moral sense to be better than those who fail. And I think that's tied to the idea that from hard work comes success. And so if you're constantly failing, perhaps you're not working hard enough, perhaps you're not capitalizing on whatever talents you might have and so on. And so there's a strong moral dimension to not succeeding. I

**Shankar Vedantam:** mean, it's also the case that I many of us equate goals with self-respect. So if we don't reach a goal, we feel like we've lost respect for ourselves. Yeah,

**Adam Alter:** that's right. I think humans as a species are completionists. It's very important to us to finish things, even if the exercise is futile. And so this idea of finishing something you start has a strong moral element to it.

**Shankar Vedantam:** When we turn ordinary goals into moral causes, we switch from being what social scientists call satisficers to maximizers. Instead of asking if what we have accomplished is good enough, we adopt all-or thinking. If you decide you want to run a marathon in under three hours and finish the race in three hours and ten minutes, this extraordinary feat of human endurance gets counted as a failure. If you want to write five articles in the course of a year,

**Adam Alter:** It's very important to us to finish things, even if the exercise is futile. And so this idea of finishing something you start has a strong moral element to it.

**Shankar Vedantam:** When we turn ordinary goals into moral causes, we switch from being what social scientists call satisficers to maximizers. Instead of asking if what we have accomplished is good enough, we adopt all-or thinking. If you decide you want to run a marathon in under three hours and finish the race in three hours and ten minutes, this extraordinary feat of human endurance gets counted as a failure. If you want to write five articles in the course of a year, but only manage four, this means you've fallen short. If you decide you want to save $1,000 more in a savings account, putting away $880 can leave you feeling disappointed. Thinking this way can contribute to a feeling of being stuck, or what Adam calls stuckness. Yeah,

**Adam Alter:** those round numbers are really dangerous in all those contexts because they form artificial goals that we, I say, fetishize. And I think that's an accurate description because it's something that we take so seriously that really becomes a legitimate goal for us. One

**Shankar Vedantam:** of the other things that you and other researchers have found is that many of us

**Shankar Vedantam:** in countries like the United States.

**Adam Alter:** Yeah, this actually goes back to some of the early research I did as a graduate student. I was very interested in how different cultures perceive change. And what I discovered is that in the West, countries like the United States, we tend to experience change as rare. We don't think it happens all that often. And we tend to think of things as linear. And so in some studies, I gave people some stock charts and asked them to predict how the stock was going to perform. Some of those stocks had done well in the past, and they tended to think they'd continue to do well. Some had done poorly. They expected them to continue to do poorly. Or I'd give them some weather charts and I'd say, hey, it's been sunny 10 days in a row. What do you think is going to happen tomorrow? They would predict more sun. Or if it had been raining, they predicted more rain. But in the East, in Korea, in Japan, in China, you get the very opposite. And so there's this interesting cultural difference where people in the East seem to predict much more change, variation, balance, correction. When a stock's been doing well, the other shoe is about to drop. And so the stock's probably going to decline. When it's been doing badly, it's likely to do well. It's been sunny, it's going to start raining, and so on. And one of the interesting things about the view that the West seems to have of change, which is that it's unusual, is that it leaves you uniquely ill-prepared for the fact that life is

**Shankar Vedantam:** if it's been raining nine days in a row, it's going to be raining the 10th day as well. And, of course, that then contributes to my feeling of I will never get out of this rut that I'm in.

**Adam Alter:** Yeah. And so it's a sort of double-edged trap there where you are blindsided when things go badly and when you experience stuckness. But also in the midst of that stuckness, you can't imagine it ever ending. You

**Shankar Vedantam:** write about a video posted online by the actress Brie Larson. She won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in the movie Room. And she's had leading roles in blockbuster movies like The Marvels. In this clip, she talks about the secret of her success. I

got told no 98 to 99 percent of the time. I know it's like hard to like fully wrap your brain around. It's even hard for me to wrap my brain around and think of the fact that I've been on like thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of auditions.

**Shankar Vedantam:** It's sort of crazy. So that's a lot of failure, Adam, and not what you think of when you think about a very successful movie star. So

**Adam Alter:** often we focus on colossal success, but for someone with Brie Larson's degree of success to be transparent about her failures and the fact that by her own account, it's 98 to 99% of the time that she's failing, I think is really disarming and offers a real note of hope. And so

**Adam Alter:** often we focus on colossal success, but for someone with Brie Larson's degree of success to be transparent about her failures and the fact that by her own account, it's 98 to 99% of the time that she's failing, I think is really disarming and offers a real note of hope. And so not surprisingly, people really latched onto that video. And I found it a very interesting piece of evidence.

**Shankar Vedantam:** I'm wondering if there's an important insight here, which is that succeeding often means a sustained tolerance for failure. I mean, it sounds paradoxical, but, you know, winners are not people who never lose. They're people who can tolerate losing long enough for things to break their way. Yeah.

**Adam Alter:** And there's a lot of research looking, for example, at the course of careers in various different pursuits. They look at artists, they look at film writers, they look at book writers and other people and ask where is the most successful period of that artist's life's work. And the answer is, it's hard to predict. And there are people they describe as having early in their careers, they have their biggest successes, some during the summertime in the of their careers, and then some during the fall or the wintertime at the end of their careers. And so, yeah, you don't know necessarily where those periods are going to arise, but you have to stay in the game, keep pushing even against maybe 98% to 99% of failure, as Larson describes, for the successes to emerge.

**Adam Alter:** to decide on color. And so, what Solage decided quite early on was that he was just going to use black paint. And by stripping away the question of color, of hue, he would leave himself with a much simpler set of decisions to make. And so he could really focus and refine his understanding of how to use that one tone of paint to create the works that he was making. And so he became known as the artist who only used black paint. feel stuck because

**Shankar Vedantam:** you have hit a dreaded plateau, the solution is to introduce change. Start a new kind of workout. If you are a writer of prose, try your hand at poetry. If you're a musician, try playing your instrument with your non-dominant hand. Adam has also studied the idea that reframing problems as challenges can be effective in getting yourself unstuck. He has looked at one particular kind of problem that many people confront in workplaces and educational settings. There's

**Adam Alter:** a very well-known phenomenon in social psychology known as stereotype threat, which is the idea that if you know that you belong to a particular group that is negatively stereotyped in a particular domain, just knowing that is overwhelming and it makes it harder for you to perform well. So some of the research looked at women in
