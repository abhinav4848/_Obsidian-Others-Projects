## Snips

###  [Diving Deep into Learning Multiple Fields](https://share.snipd.com/snip/65614a7a-4c79-4cf0-96c7-2d65fb62a616) 

🎧 19:57 - 21:21 (01:24)

The speaker delves into multiple fields by studying various resources like textbooks, academic papers, and YouTube videos to gain a comprehensive understanding. Despite becoming obsessed and trying to cover statistical genetics and computational genomics along with full stack development simultaneously due to limited resources, the speaker believes that delving into various fields provided a good intuition and foundational knowledge to guide others efficiently.

#### 📚 Transcript

And then I actually, and this was actually one of those things, right? I became probably a little bit too obsessed in this, but you could see in the notebooks, I would basically try to, to the best you can really start from the very, very, very, very beginning, and then just slowly, because it was a mix of different textbooks and academic papers, YouTube videos, you know, a whole host of things. I actually had like a, I wrote myself an essay that was like, the essay title was One Man Revolution, which I love retrospectively, because it's like, you're literally in your bedroom just like kind of messing with yourself, I told one man revolution, and now it's no longer one man, it's just a revolution. And that's why I find so beautiful on the kind of arc of the journey, but in an, I kind of outlined like the transition and kind of the plan of what I was going to do. And I was like, oh, well, you know, there's like the statistical genetics and kind of computation, computational genomics. And here's like a bunch of resources. It's crazy. It was like, it was so freaking long. And also, yeah, I can build the web app to, you know, the full stack development. Oh, that won't be a problem. Right. Of course, I should have just focused on only the statistical genetics, but I'm trying to do both at the same time at the time, because again, you have no resources. And that's another beautiful thing, which is that no resources, you're like, I have to do everything. But in trying to do literally everything, you get a good intuition for, well, and then you can start having this kind of foundation, which you can start pulling people in and you know exactly what to tell them to do. Anyways, then I would basically do this. And basically each and every day, I started getting kind of a deeper and deeper. It's like almost like I was in a cave, shining a flashlight.

###  [Vision, Execution, Relentlessness, and Questioning in Achieving Success](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fa1d26c3-7b24-47a9-8728-693730ebed0e) 

🎧 26:33 - 28:05 (01:31)

Having a clear vision combined with effective execution is crucial in navigating the complexities of translating ideas into products. The ability to relentlessly pursue answers, ask the right questions, and avoid settling for assumptions is key in intellectual exploration and achieving substantial progress.

#### 📚 Transcript

And I think

sometimes, you know, it's having that vision is very important because if someone can both have the vision and then have the execution, because anyone can kind of sit back and be like, oh, there should be this thing like, oh, you know, that's kind of the easy part. There's a much hard part is to have the clarity of vision of what you want to, and then actually figuring out the maze of how to get there, how to go from 101 all the way up to the frontier of knowledge, and then to actually productize that information,

right? Because there's

a completely different skill set too. Right. Talking about the investigative enterprise and dichotomy.

Totally. And what's interesting to me is like, there's kind of two key traits here. One doesn't have to do with relentlessness. It's more of how to be a good question-asker, like how to ask the right questions to explore answers to. And I think one way to do that is to know what your end goal is, because then that kind of acts as this constant, you know, magnetic force of keeping your questions within what's relevant and important. But then there is the aspect of being relentless. Like to me, the fact that you spent 12 hours a day for 12 months doing this, it was the only way to get to the intellectual frontier. Because I think what actually happens to most people intellectually when they don't go as far down the rabbit holes you can go, is I would actually argue that what happens is whether consciously or unconsciously, they realize it's going to take a lot of time to answer these questions. And so instead of answering these questions, they stop at the assumption layer. They just stop at assuming a truth of why it is versus investigating. And

you literally have to

spend years to answer every question there is to be answered. Yes.

###  [The Pathological Motivation and Fear of Stagnation](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0f7a6b19-11c6-4b3c-a586-8068c2bf5710) 

🎧 29:45 - 30:55 (01:10)

The speaker defines relentlessness as pathological motivation, explained as a combination of fear and love. The fear that drove the speaker was the fear of stagnating and not fulfilling personal aspirations. Additionally, the speaker felt suffocated in college and experienced a continuous sense of not being aligned with their desires, potentially guided by their soul. The fear was further fueled by the pressure imposed by the achievements and struggles of immigrant parents, instilling a drive to succeed and make the most of the opportunities presented in America.

#### 📚 Transcript

Yeah. And at a curiosity, so you define relentlessness as pathological motivation. Yeah. And

you explain

that motivation is this combination of fear and love. Yes. For you, what was the fear? I think there's

a lot of fear. Juan was definitely a fear of kind of peedering out and just stagnating. I felt like honestly my time in college, it felt a little bit suffocating for me personally. It felt suffocating. If I like this drip by drip, like losing of just like, what are you doing here? This doesn't feel right for what I want to do, which of course was my soul speaking to me, which they know, thank God. Listen, close your eyes, listen carefully. I was thinking there was a fear of, I mean, my parents are immigrants from Iran, they do not come to America and struggle how they struggled. And I think as any first generation can say, your parents give you sort of the immigrant drive combined with the opportunity of America. And to go to a school like Penn and then to leave, I mean, you know, there's all, I mean, the fear is, whoa.

###  [Unveiling Assumptions and Distractions in Society](https://share.snipd.com/snip/26299392-47ff-4a21-9d7b-1071432cc4d7) 

🎧 33:01 - 34:25 (01:24)

Individuals unknowingly operate under a set of assumptions when joining a new system, akin to walking in an intellectual castle. Uncovering these ingrained structures is pivotal for growth, akin to realizing one has been living by someone else's rules. Stripping away these assumptions is essential to unveil distractions and societal pressures, allowing for a more focused and authentic way of living.

#### 📚 Transcript

But, but there's some, there was some sort of clarity of imagine if old infrastructure of society temporarily halted, right? Basically, like, I like to say this sometimes when, when a new person joins nucleus, which is they might not realize it, but they're walking around in an intellectual castle, right? There's been, you know, 10,000 assumptions that they're on, operate under that they come into the system. And the job of the founder is to relish it at a drawer, seeing that structure. It's almost like, you know, a child is born and the parents, like, you know, they come in the middle of the story, right? And the child doesn't know that. And as they grow up, they see that, wait a second, I was actually operating under someone else's thinking. And this gets back to your question because I think you need to kind of strip away all those assumptions, right? And one good example of this is early on in the bedroom, the weirdest thing, the weirdest thing was waking up and just, just doing 12 hours of work. That might be weird because it's like literally I'd wake up and just be in my bedroom all day, just writing notebooks. I'd never done that before. Thing might be, oh, there's soccer practice. There's, you know, of this class, that class again, like even in, even in colleges, classes, it's like split between many subjects potentially, right? There's like such a fraction. Oh, this extracurricular, oh, you're dating someone, oh, your best friend wants you to get dinner, right? There's this, oh, your parents are pushing you to become a medical

doctor. Yeah, it's all, it's a combination of distractions and ways of, like being that have been just created for you and that you don't even realize you're operating under. I made a joke in the one man revolution essay.
