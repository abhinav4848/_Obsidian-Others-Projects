###  [The Importance of Learning How to Think](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a0b9fd62-28b8-41e2-970c-ba6b97274847) 

🎧 00:00 - 01:45 (01:45)

The importance of learning how to think versus learning what to think is discussed in this episode. Alex Lieberman shares insights and inspiration from a tweet by Justin Khan, co-founder of Twitch. Khan emphasizes the value of books that teach thinking skills, particularly philosophy, for personal and professional growth.

Welcome back to founder's journal, my personal audio diary, where i give you the business builder the tools you need to think better in order to build better. Whether that's building a business, a team or a new product. To day, i am talking about the importance of learning how to think versus learning what to think. Let's hop into it. So i recently saw this tweet from justin khan, who is the co founder of twitch. And it got me thinking. His tweet was, if you can read books that teach you how to think, not what to think. And then he had to follow up on that tweet saying, this is why philosophy is so important. And i think this is such a valuable idea, not just in the context of reading books, but in the context of just thinking in general, in life, in your career, et cetera.

###  [The Need for Critical Thinking and How to Foster It](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8118933b-ec55-4afa-8bc9-e3c53a63f8dc) 

🎧 06:25 - 07:51 (01:26)

In a study comparing Japan and the US, it was found that more than half of all problems in Japan are connection problems, compared to only 20% in the US. This problem of teaching what to think instead of how to think is widespread, from education to management. It prevents us from becoming exceptional critical thinkers and decision makers. To change this, we must embrace the struggle, learn to think critically, and resist the urge to avoid discomfort.

#### 📚 Transcript

And the results of that same study show so in japan, a little more than half of all problems are making connection problems, versus 20 % in the us. And half of them stayed that way through solving. Now i want to be clear a picking on education in the early years of our lives, but this is a widespread problem. We are taught throughout life in so many contexts, what to think versus how to think. Our teachers give us past exams to study as a way to prepare for future exams. Most managers or bosses give answers and orders rather than direction and facilitation. And the big issue with that is it deprives us of becoming exceptional critical thinkers and decision makers. We are taught to be thought followers, rather than thought leaders. And our default becomes pattern matching over critical thinking. But that's it. Critical thinking is the homar quality of top performing professionals, leaders and founders. In this current model, we continue to trade off long term quality thinking for short term alleviation of intellectual pain. So the obvious quest on is, how do we change this? How can we do things that force us to learn how to think and force us to think critically? I have five recommendations. Number one, embrace the struggle. We do not like being uncomfortable. We do everything possible to avoid it. We procrastinate instead of doing the task. We ask for help instead of fighting through it.
