###  [What to Look for in a First Employee for an Early Stage Company](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4ab784e6-9d8e-4af0-ae93-d46ff751fc67)

1. The content strategist role requires great account management skills and the ability to build trust and deep relationships with clients.
2. Content strategists should be able to shape a client's experience and goals into specific niche and content pillars.
3. Attention to detail and a strong work ethic are essential qualities for content strategists.
4. When hiring, it is important to compare a candidate's skills and qualifications against the job description.
5. Early stage companies should look for employees who have the potential to start their own company in the future.
6. The best early employees have characteristics that make for great future founders.
7. These characteristics include being proactive and a force of nature.

And so for example, for the content strategist role, the skills included great account management skills, someone who has an ability to build trust and deep relationships with clients, great content strategy skills, someone who is able to take a client's experience and their goals and shape that into a specific niche and content pillars that will help them achieve that goal, someone who has deep attention to detail and someone who has killer work ethic. So those were table stakes for any first hire given that was the job to be done. And so within your company, you had to have a similar type of thing where you have a JD that has all of the skills, the essentials, the superpowers that this person needs. And you compare that against what you saw from them in the interview process. But then the second question we would ask ourselves, which in my opinion is what any company, any early stage company should be looking for in their first employee and really in several of their early employees is the following question. Can we see this person starting their own company after they leave here? And we want to be able to say yes with whoever we choose as employee number one, because my view is that the best early employees have the characteristics that make for great future founders. And there are four simple characteristics in my mind. First they are a force of nature. They pull an entire company forward because they're proactive.

###  [Key Characteristics of Successful Early Employees in Startups](https://share.snipd.com/snip/76bd3915-f6f1-41b4-919f-e0cacaa324d3) 

🎧 07:44 - 09:06 (01:21)

1. They are a critical thinker.
2. They prioritize information and form their own opinions.
3. They have an obsessive brain when they believe in the mission.
4. Self-awareness is important for early employees.
5. Hiring tools can help to find all-star employees.

#### 📚 Transcript

Second, they are a critical thinker. There is so much information being thrown at you in the early days of a company and at startups in general. This person is great at not only taking in the information and prioritizing what's worth spending time focusing on, but they're also great at forming opinions based on the information they have rather than what they've been told to do or doing things how they've always been done. The third is they have an obsessive brain. When they feel purposeful in their work and they believe in the mission, this person can't stop thinking about the business. Some may argue that it's unhealthy, but I disagree. If they are lit up and fulfilled by the work they are doing, as long as they are not neglecting their health or any of the other buckets in their life that are important to them, I want them to be as obsessed as humanly possible with the work they're doing. And the fourth characteristic, they are self-aware. The best entrepreneurs have a clear understanding of the few things that they're great at and all of the things that are weaknesses that will hold back the company, if not fixed or delegated to someone else. Self-awareness is the key to self-growth and that's why I think it's so important for your early employees to have it. Otherwise, their pace of growth won't be fast enough to keep up with the company. So with all of that said, we have hired employee number one at StoryArb and depending on when this episode comes out, they're either just about to start or they will have already started and these are the tools that we used in order to give ourselves the best chance of hiring an all-star.
