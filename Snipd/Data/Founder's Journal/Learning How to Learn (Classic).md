The goal is to create a foundational understanding that allows flexibility in facing any challenge. Join the episode to learn and adopt this approach to learning.

#### 📚 Transcript

And it it made made me me think think about about just just learning learning anything anything new new, broadly broadly, and and what what the the process process is is that that I've i've gone gone through through in in the the past past to to go go down down the the rabbit rabbit hole hole and and learn learn something something new. newand I i think think it's it's really really important to to think think about about t it. and i And I think think it's it's something something we we often often don't don't think think about about in in the the rush rush of of life. life. It's It's this this idea idea that that in in a a world world of of information information abundance abundance and and limited limited time, time, it's it's more more important important than than ever ever to to understand understand how how to to go go about about learning learning in in an an efficient efficient and and effective effective way. way. And And so so my my goal goal for for this this episode episode is is I'm i'm going going to to map map out out my my process process for for going going down down a a rabbit rabbit hole hole. and And a a process process that that you you can can use use for for learning learning anything anything new new in in your your career career or or your your personal personal life. life. So So let's let's hop hop into into it. it. I I think think about about the the process process of of learning learning like like the the process process of of test test taking taking in in college. college. I fundamentally fundamentally believe believe there there are are two two types types of of students. students. You You have have the the memorizer memorizer and and you you have have the the understander. understander. The The memorizer memorizer is is the the student student who who studies studies past past exams exams and and their their answers. answers. And And the the understander understander is is the the student student who who studies studies the the textbook, text book, reflects reflects on on the the principles principles from from reading reading that that text textbook. book. And And so so then then no no matter matter what what test test is is put put in in front front of of them, them, whether whether it's it similar similar or or dissimilar dissimilar from from past past exams, exams, their their mind mind can can adapt adapt to to the the challenge challenge because because they they understand understand things things at at a a foundational foundational level. level. That That is is the the foundation foundation that that I i am am trying trying to to create create through through this this process process of of learning learning that that i've I've gone gone through through, and and that that i I want want you you to to learn learn from. from.

###  [How to Curate Content: Leveraging Social Media for Recommendations](https://share.snipd.com/snip/00f5ed97-6340-4ded-8aab-6d5ba27cce53) 

🎧 03:54 - 05:13 (01:19)

To curate content, you can leverage social media and ask for recommendations from trusted individuals. For instance, I posted on Twitter asking for resources about Ethereum and decentralized organizations. Within 24 hours, I received 25 valuable recommendations. By creating opportunities for others to add value, you not only receive help but also benefit from their knowledge. Sharing content also serves as a way for people to showcase their expertise.

#### 📚 Transcript

And so so how how do do you you go go about about curating? curating? There's There's a a lot lot of of ways, ways, but i but I'm can going to higlight highlight a a few. few. One One way way is is, if if you're you're active active on on social social media, media, super super easy easy to to just just post post on on Twitter, twitter, post post on on linked LinkedIn, in, you you know, know, droping drop an instagram Instagram story, story, asking asking people people who who you you trust, trust, what what have have they they read, read, watched watched or or listened listened to to about about a a topic. topic. So So for for example, example, I i wanted wanted to to learn learn a a lot lot about about Ethereum. etherium, And and i I wanted wanted to to learn learn a a lot lot about about decentralized decentralized, autonomous autonomous organizations, organizations, just just two two very very specific specific corners corners of of the the world world of of block blockchain chain technology. technology. All All I i did did was was post posted it on on Twitter twitter, or or I i tweeted, tweeded, what what are are the the best best long long reads reeds that that you've you've read read about about etherium, Ethereum? or Or what what are are the the best best YouTube youtube channels channels that that break break down down all all of the the applications applications of of etherium? Ethereum? And And within within 24 24 hours, hours, i I had had 25 25 different different resources resources that that were were shared shared by by people people on on Twitter twitter who who i I trust trust and and i I follow. follow. So So that that is is one one super super easy, easy, low low time time commitment, commitment, high high signal signal opportunity opportunity. is Is literally literally just just create create the the opportunity opportunity for for the the people people that that you you follow, follow, who who you're you're connected connected with with on on social social media media, to to add add value value to to you. you. And And I i think think, you youno know, in general, general, f you if think you think about about it, it, people people are are going going to to want want to to do do that that for for two two reasons. reasons. One One is, is they they want want to to help help people people that that they're they're connected connected with. with. Two, Two, it's it's an an amazing amazing form form of of social social signaling signalling. when When people people can can share share content content they've they've consumed, consumed. It it shows shows an an elevated elevated level level of of knowledge knowledge that that they they have. have. Let's

###  [Approaches to Curating and Consuming Content](https://share.snipd.com/snip/230bd82c-9d95-4744-95ec-57a0d2800f0a) 

🎧 07:10 - 08:35 (01:25)

Finding high signal content in the vastness of the internet can be overwhelming, but there are ways to curate and consume it effectively. The key is to be an active and iterative consumer, not just passively absorbing information. This means actively searching for and evaluating content that aligns with your interests and constantly optimizing your consumption habits. Instead of feeling obligated to read every word of every book, focus on the content that truly engages you. Be a discerning consumer, not a completionist.

#### 📚 Transcript

Curation is is all all about, about how how do do you you find find high high signal signal content content fast? fast? How How do do you you start start narrowing narrowing all all of of the the abundance abundance in in the the inter internet net in in a a way way that that is is manageable manageable and and approachable approachable for for you? you? And And the the three three recommendations recommendations I i gave gave are are ways ways to to start start curating curating all all of that that content content into into something something that that is is manageable. manageable. Step Step two two after curation curation is is consumption. consumption. And And consumption, consumption, obviously, obviously, it it sounds sounds simple, simple, but but i I think think there's there's a a ton ton of of nuance nuance to to how how you you end end up up being being a a good good consumer. consumer. And And i I think think the the key key to to being being a a good good consumer consumer is is being being both both an an active active and and iterative iterative consumer. consumer. And And what what i I mean mean by by that that is is, you you can can consume consume on on autopilot auto pilot, or or you you can can consume consume in in a a way way that that you you are are on on offense, offence, in in a a way way that that is is solidifying solid fing the the content content and and the the principles principles as as you're you're reading reading them. them. And when i say you can be an iterative iterative consumer, consumer, that that means means not not just just reading reading all all the the content content you you said said you you would would read, read, but but optimizing optimizing what what content content you're you're consuming consuming as as you you go go about about consuming, consuming and and seeing seeing what what you you really really like like verses versus what what you you don't don't like. like. So So here here are are a a few few rules rules for for being being an an active active and and iterative iterative consumer. consumer. The The first first is is, don't don't consume consume content content to to finality finality. or from From beginning beginning to to end end, just just for for the the sake sake of of it. it. When When i I started started being being like like an an active active reader, reader, i I used used to to feel feel like like every every single single book book I i read, read, I i had had to to read read it it beginning beginning to to end end with with every every word word accounted accounted for, for, or or there there was was this this feeling feeling of of disappointment, disappointment like like i I didn't didn't finish finish the the book. book.

Having pure reflection is like having a conversation with a good listener to test your understanding of what you've read. It's even better if you can talk to someone knowledgeable about the subject or the author themselves. Reflection allows for deeper learning and retention of information. Parrish describes it as a first order negative and second order positive approach with visible short term costs.

Then Then you you have have pure peer reflection, reflection, which which is is where where you you literally literally just just have have a a conversation conversation with with anyone anyone willing willing to to listen. listen. Even Even if if i I read read Matt mat Ball ball stuff, stuff, I'd i'd be be fine fine having having a a conversation conversation with with my my sister sister, who who knows knows nothing nothing about about entertainment enter men and and gaming, gaming if if she's she's just just a a great great listener. listener.
