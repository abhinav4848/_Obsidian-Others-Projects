###  [Finding Your Purpose: The IKIGAI Framework and the A, B, C, Z Process](https://share.snipd.com/snip/be4ac213-16f2-42ef-95df-3fa55f1fd361) 

🎧 05:21 - 06:46 (01:25)

I set a goal to make $20 million by the age of 30. I also learned about Iki Guy, a concept that helps find a fulfilling career. It involves finding something you enjoy, are skilled at, the world wants, and will pay for. The best situation is to find something in the middle of all four circles. However, if you're starting out, prioritize what the world needs and will pay for. This is part of the A, B, C, Z process, where A is researching the company and Z is the final step.

#### 📚 Transcript

I said to myself, I want $20 million by the age of 30 and that was my timeline and that was my goal. The second thing that I look for is called Iki Guy and that's I-K-I-G-A-I and you guys should Google that and this will be really easy to understand. But basically it's this big Venn diagram of four different circles. Circle one is what do you enjoy doing? Circle two is what do you skill that? Circle three is what does the world want? And circle four is what will the world pay for? Ideally, you want to find something right in the middle of that because if you find something right in the middle of that, the likelihood that you're going to be able to pursue it because it's going to feel a little bit more like a vocation, like a purpose is a little bit higher. If you find something that you have very little passion for but the world needs and is willing to pay for it, that's basically just a job. If you find something that the world really wants that you're good at, that's a mission. That's a hobby. No one's going to buy it. And so the ideal situation is to find something right in the middle. However, if you're poor, like I was, if you're just getting started out, I would rank the passion part the lowest and I would rank the what the world needs and what they're willing to pay for the highest. This is about, I call it, or my partner Sean on the podcast, I call that we call it the A, B, C, Z process. Meaning right now we're thinking about the process of A, which is just researching the company and process Z.

###  [Surrounding Yourself with Information: Tools for Research](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e8f22a6e-5914-4943-9a17-f44f8f3ad8a5) 

🎧 08:44 - 10:05 (01:21)

He broke the four-minute mile, which was previously thought impossible. Soon after, three others broke the record too. Surrounding yourself with the right information expands your mind. Research tools include finding market demand, identifying the audience, studying successful leaders, recognizing shortcomings, determining ideal business models, and solving unmet customer problems.

#### 📚 Transcript

He broke four minutes in the mile. For the 10 years before that, the world record was 402. People couldn't break four minutes in the mile. He broke it. And with literally within 60 days, three other people broke it. The point being is when you surround yourself, even just like mentally, you study other people and study other business models, when you surround yourself in the information that you need, it starts to expand your mind. And so that's why I think this is really important. And so I'm going to give you three different tools that I use to research. So the first thing that I look for is demand. I'm trying to find what problems do people have? I want to find demand in a market. I'm not trying to create demand. The second thing is I want to figure out who's the audience, meaning how many people are there that share this problem as well as who are they? The next thing is I'm going to look at the leaders, who's succeeding in the space and why. After that, number four is the shortcomings. So the people who are succeeding, where are they missing the mark or leaving opportunity that I can go out and grab? Number five, and this is really important for me when I was starting the hustle, which is which business models work best for me and why? And then finally, what problems amongst the successful companies aren't being met? What problems do I think customers have that aren't being met? So this example, I was just browsing on the internet because I wanted to find a VPN. A VPN is a piece of software that kind of hides where you are.

###  [Using Moat to Analyze Advertisements of Kettle and Fire: Insights on the Target Audience](https://share.snipd.com/snip/64c5dbde-f868-4381-942e-1f1813ad6b3f) 

🎧 16:24 - 17:55 (01:30)

"Moat is a super cool tool that lets you see the advertisements different companies are running. For example, I wanted to know who the customers of Kettle and Fire, a bone broth company, are. When I typed in Kettle and Fire on moat.com, I discovered that the majority of their ads feature a white woman with gray hair and great skin."

#### 📚 Transcript

Now,

I want to tell you the final tool for this episode, which is moat. Moat is a really cool tool. There's other tools like Facebook ad archive. You can do that as well. If you Google Facebook ad archive, but the idea behind both Facebook ad archive as well as moat is it lets you see which advertisements different companies are running. The reason that's important is because I want to see who the brand is appealing to and I could typically see that in what type of ads they're running. I'm going to give you a very specific example. The reason why I'm giving this example is I'm friends with the founder of this company and I came up with a hypothesis of who their customers are, how it works. When I emailed him and I go, hey, did I nail this? I got a text message back from him or an email back from him and said, yep, you got it. Let's use this example. If you go to moat, you type in kettle and fire. Kettle and fire is a broth company. They make bone broth, which is something that you drink, I guess, to a health drink. At first, when I was thinking of bone broth, I thought, who drinks this? Meatheads? Is this a Joe Rogan-y type of thing where it's usually young men? Who's about bone broth? I don't know anything about that. Let's just say that I was interested in creating a health product. I'm like, well, bone broth is intriguing. The leader in the space, I think, is Kettle and Fire. They're one of who's buying this stuff. I type in kettle and fire into moat.com. What you'll see is that the majority of ads are women. It's a white woman with gray hair, but she's got really nice skin.
