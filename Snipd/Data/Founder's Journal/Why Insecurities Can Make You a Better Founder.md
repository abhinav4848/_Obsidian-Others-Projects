###  [The Importance of Sharing Insecurities and Vulnerabilities as a Leader](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5f76e2a8-0c91-4c27-870a-6248a9d74194) 

🎧 08:02 - 08:41 (00:38)

Being open and sharing insecurities and vulnerabilities as a leader is important. It demonstrates self-awareness and shows that you are able to recognize and work on your weaknesses. It also gives permission for others to be open and not fear looking weak or being wrong. Sharing insecurities can be emotionally cathartic and prevent the burden of carrying them alone.

#### 📚 Transcript

I don't share my insecurities to be vulnerable for the sake of being vulnerable. I don't do it because I think this idea of vulnerability is in vogue in the professional world right now. I truly believe that it is wildly important for a leader to be open in this way. It shows a sense of self-awareness because if you don't call out your own vulnerabilities, people may wonder if you have the self-awareness to spot them and work on them. It also gives people permission to be open and not fear looking weak or being wrong. And I personally find it to be cathartic emotionally where I don't have to carry the weight of these feelings, of these insecurities, of these vulnerabilities all by myself.
