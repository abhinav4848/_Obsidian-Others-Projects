###  [Feeling Like an Outsider in My Own Business](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3fd5f147-e8c5-47c3-aff8-67730332d723) 

🎧 02:54 - 04:21 (01:26)

As I worked on my business, I simultaneously felt like an outsider, disconnected from conversations and strategies. I realized that I had knowledge FOMO and felt like I was missing out on important learning opportunities. However, I reframed these feelings as an opportunity for growth and embraced my curiosity and wonder. I believe that my learning FOMO drives me to stay curious and intellectually grow.

#### 📚 Transcript

On one hand, everyone was working on things related to a business that I helped create and build. On the other hand, I felt like an outsider, lots of people that I've never met and who may not know me, conversations and strategies that I'm no longer a part of. I don't know how else to describe the feeling other than feeling like a stranger. Now, I know this is a story like any story we create in our heads, but I think it is interesting to examine why I feel this way and what I can take from this experience. For starters, I definitely have knowledge FOMO. When I see people talking about the intricacies of the business or Austin talking strategy with our super impressive and intelligent senior leaders, I feel FOMO that I'm missing out on key learnings that would help grow my mind and my abilities as an entrepreneur. Second, I'm trying to reframe these thoughts and feelings as an opportunity and a gift. I think it makes a ton of sense that I have these thoughts and I acknowledge myself for being able to notice them and sit in the not so great feelings of isolation and envy. I also respect the fact that this entire story I created in my head is a byproduct of my own creativity and curiosity and wonder which are all great things and I would never want to get rid of. Third, I actually welcome learning FOMO. I think it's an awesome quality that leads me to staying curious and growing intellectually.

###  [Understanding Thoughts and Feelings: Self Awareness and Reflection](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c24d5568-88e5-4a0f-89ec-a609fa290819) 

🎧 05:47 - 07:07 (01:20)

The author reflects on feeling envious and sad about their new chapter in life. They realize that thoughts and feelings aren't good or bad, but it's important to be self-aware and choose how to act on them. They find comfort in a quote by James Clear about having fewer commitments and more experiments before discovering what you love, and then having fewer experiments and more commitments afterwards.

#### 📚 Transcript

And then my brain did this weird trick that so many of our brains do. It judged my thoughts and feelings of envy. How could I feel envious and sad about what I'm experiencing? I should and should as a dangerous word. I should feel grateful for the opportunities that my company has afforded me and I should feel excited that 200 plus people are excitedly working on this business every day. And so I both experienced an envy of those working on the brew today as well as a feeling about the feeling while also sitting in the reality of my new chapter, which is a lot less clear and in some ways a lot more uncomfortable than the previous eight years of my life. But I want to use this reflection as a reframe because our thoughts and our feelings aren't good or bad. They just are. But our level of self awareness around our thoughts and feelings and what we choose to do with them, that is what's really important and what really matters. There's a great quote by James Clear that offers me comfort and grounding in this moment. He said, before you discover what you love, have fewer commitments and more experiments. After you discover what you love, have fewer experiments and more commitments. As I think about my life in the context of this quote, my shift out of the day to day of morning
