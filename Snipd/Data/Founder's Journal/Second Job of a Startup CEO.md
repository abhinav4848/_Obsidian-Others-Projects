###  [Defining Mission, Strategy, and Metrics for Startups](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5288f206-9101-45d7-b609-937ad55fac24) 

🎧 15:04 - 16:28 (01:23)

The Phase 2 CEO's role shifts from rowing the boat to defining the mission (purpose), strategy (direction), and metrics (pace and performance) for the startup. These elements offer the necessary context for a growing company's success. Alignment between mission and metrics is crucial, as exemplified by a SpaceX employee linking his work to the company's mission of colonizing Mars through designing reusable rockets. This story underscores the significance of clear, simple, and inspiring articulation of a startup's mission, strategy, and metrics.

#### 📚 Transcript

As a Phase 1 CEO, you are the lead rower on the boat. But in a Phase 2 startup, your job is no longer to row. Instead, it's to define the purpose of the voyage, set the direction of the boat, and measure the pace and performance of a much larger number of rowers. In business speak, the CEO's job is to define the mission, aka the purpose, the strategy, aka the direction, and the metrics, aka the pace and performance. These three elements provide the essential context that a growing company needs to be able to perform. One of the best examples of quote-unquote mission to metrics alignment comes from a friend who visited the manufacturing floor at SpaceX. Seeing a SpaceX employee assembling a large part, he stopped to ask him, what is your job at SpaceX? And he answered, the mission of SpaceX is to colonize Mars. In order to colonize Mars, we need to build reusable rockets because it will otherwise be unaffordable for humans to travel to Mars and back. My job is to help design the steering system that enables our rockets to land back on Earth. You'll know if I've succeeded if our rockets land on our platform in the Atlantic after launch. The employee could have simply said he was building a steering system for landing rockets. Instead, he recited the company's entire mission to metrics framework. That is alignment. Can you define the mission, strategy, and metrics for your startup in a way that's clear, simple, and inspiring?

###  [Consistent Communication and Nurturing Company Culture](https://share.snipd.com/snip/502d3259-e6cc-4f25-b331-13c7debce7f1) 

🎧 18:13 - 19:33 (01:20)

Consistently communicate the mission to metrics to all employees, as repetition is key to internalizing the message. Nurturing company culture is crucial, defined by how people treat each other at the company, with behaviors defining the culture more than written words.

#### 📚 Transcript

Once you've written mission to metrics for your startup and gotten feedback from your leadership and other key employees, you have to start communicating it to everyone regularly. You have to reiterate the mission to metrics much more than what feels reasonable, which may run counter to your instinct to be efficient. Just something to reiterate here is repetition is a CEO's best friend and you need to say things dozens of times before it really sinks in with everyone. And it ends up being the thing that everyone repeats and knows to repeat. It has to become second nature to everyone. Your employees will not internalize the message unless you communicate it constantly. The real test is not simply whether employees can repeat it, but whether they can make good decisions in your absence based on the context you've provided. And number three, nurturing company culture. There are a few concepts in company building that are as slippery as culture. Fundamentally, culture is defined by the way that people treat one another in a company, both the way management treats employees and the way that people treat one another. I will say my favorite definition of culture is Jason Freed's, he founded 37 Signals. And his definition of culture is that a company's culture is a 50 day moving average of your actions and your company's actions. And I love that because it is all based on behaviors and not some words that are written on a wall.

###  [Cultural Tenets and Success Measures](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3c823018-dc86-4612-8eba-b03489b66397) 

🎧 21:37 - 23:03 (01:25)

The completion of Toy Story 2 marked a pivotal moment for Pixar, leading to the belief that only great work should be produced. The core cultural tenets of Pixar emphasize no compromise creatively and taking care of people. To maintain these values, it is crucial for leaders to embody them and ensure all company members adhere to them. Success should be measured by allowing unscheduled time for curiosity and personal interaction.

#### 📚 Transcript

And when it was completed, the executive team took the extraordinary step of closing the studio for two entire months to let everyone recuperate. Ed Catmull calls it the most intense and important period in the studio's history. Toy Story 2 defined us. It said that we couldn't be a studio that produced both great work and average work. Everything we made had to be great. We proved to ourselves that we would never release a film when we were not proud of the story. And we also realized that we had to take care of our people if we were going to ask such sacrifices from them. Nothing expresses the core cultural tenets of Pixar better. Do not compromise creatively and take care of people. What defines you as a company? You should look to the past to find the answer, often to your earliest days when success was far from certain. Perhaps it's a commitment to quality, like story comes first. Perhaps it's a mode of working, like go fast and break things. Once these values have been expressed, the CEO must make sure that the behavior of every new leader at the company reflects those values. But here too, adherence is not solely the CEO's job. Everyone at the company also has a role to play in holding their leaders, peers, and themselves accountable to the same norms. And finally, a simple measure of success. During a management meeting at Pixar, I once heard Steve Jobs say, quote, when I'm at my best, 50% of my time is unscheduled. That's the time I used to think, drop in on the people I want to speak with, and let my curiosity roam.
