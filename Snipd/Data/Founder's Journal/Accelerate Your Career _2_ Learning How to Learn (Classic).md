###  [Curation as a Narrowing Process and the Importance of Trust in Content Consumption](https://share.snipd.com/snip/84530b6c-1679-4dfc-abd2-dff4c8162db6) 

🎧 03:05 - 04:33 (01:27)

Curation is essential in managing the overwhelming amount of content on the internet. By narrowing down trusted sources through Twitter lists, you can focus on the highest quality information. If you don't know where to start, look for the fastest growing companies in your specific field of interest.

#### 📚 Transcript

Curation is about getting to the highest signal content as fast as possible. Curation is what i think of as a narrowing process. Think about your content consumption as a funnel. Ryou can only allow so much information into that funnel without getting overwhelmed. Curation is the first step in you going from having all the information on the innernet to possibly consume, to somewhat focusing where you start consuming. Now the reason that curation is so important, especially to day, is because, as i've said in past founders journal episodes, the inernet has allowed for creation of content. And because of that, there is significantly more content on the internet today than there was yesterday, and there will be significantly more to morrow than there is today. So having an initial narrowing function is so incredibly important. How do i go about narrowing well, at thend of te day, the the single mental model is looked to people that i trust. So on social media, i make to curate very specific twitter lists where i follow very intentionally people that i want to see what are the imputs, what is the information that they're putting into their body? Let's say you don't know anyone to start like. You don't know the list to curate, you don't have the people you trust. In additional environment, what i would do is look up the fastest grown companies in the specific space you're interested in.

###  [Creating Ideas through Content Curation and Remixing](https://share.snipd.com/snip/97ee15c1-1382-4136-8e16-cddff1557f69) 

🎧 13:57 - 15:25 (01:28)

Curating high signal content and actively consuming it allows you to reflect and create your own ideas. Remixing existing concepts with your new knowledge leads to new ideas. This form of creation, like Morning Brew, takes existing ideas and adapts them for a new audience. The next level is original creation, inventing new ideas and markets.

#### 📚 Transcript

Once you've curated high signal content, once you've taken that high signal content and you've actively and iteratively consumed it, and then you've gone through the most important step of reflecting on what you've consumed, ou now have this solid foundation to be able to create your own ideas and points of view about the topic that you've become fluent in. Creation takes many forms, but i think the most beginner version is something that i call re mixing. That is where you connect existing ideas and combine them in a manner that they make something new. When you hear people saying, uber for x, amazon for y, pelaton for z, that's an example of remixing. You're taking an existing concept that's proven, like any of these massive tect companies, and combining it with your new knowledge that you've accumulated. And by doing so, you create a new idea. By the way, remixing isn't a bad thing, but it's the simplest form of creation. Just think about, for morning brew mortibre didn't invent business content. And inbrewd didn't invent news letters. Morning brewd just took the wall street journal and old school business media and adapted it in a form that we thought worked for our audience. We were the wall street journal for millennials. Then beyond re mixing, i would say the more elevated version of it is original creation, which is more about totally new ideas and markets that have never been invented before.
