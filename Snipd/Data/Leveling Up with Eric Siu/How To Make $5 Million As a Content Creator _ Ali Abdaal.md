## Snips

###  [Diversified Business Model and Revenue Growth through Strategic Application of Principles](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8fd8087b-1d4f-44de-92f0-0b78903b6763) 

🎧 01:57 - 03:18 (01:20)

The business model includes 99% free content and 1% paid content, with over 50% of revenue from online courses, 20% from ads and brand deals each, and 10% from affiliates. After applying principles from .com secrets, $100 million offers, and copywriting secrets, the revenue from the part time YouTube Academy course jumped from 300k to 1.9 million, showing a sevenfold increase.

#### 📚 Transcript

What's the business model look like right now? You've got courses, you've got a lot of different things going on. Yeah, so fundamentally, it's we make lots of content.

And I think of it as the 99.1.1 rule. So 99% of our content is free. 1% of our stuff is paid for the 1% of the audience who can afford it. And so like more than 50% of the revenue comes from our online courses. 20% of it also comes from ads, adsense 20% from brand deals and the other 10% from affiliates and random bits and bobs here and there. So mostly online courses. We were running our course, the part time YouTube Academy. I've been running this every few months for the last two or so years.

And you know, revenues were declining

and post pandemic. People cared a lot less about live online education as they seem to care during the pandemic. And so for

the final cohort, I

decided to just basically apply all of the principles from .com secrets and also from $100 million offers and also from copywriting secrets. So we redid the offer based on Alex Hormosy stuff. We redid the funnels based on Russell Brunson stuff and we redid the landing page based on Jim Edwards thing. And cohort seven, I think did 300k revenue. Code eight did 1.9 million. Wow. And so

it was just skyrocket. But it's almost seven times. Yeah,

like literally just purely based and you know, people sometimes ask me, oh, you know, help me make my course landing page or whatever. And I'm just like, look, just read those three books in order and just literally follow step by step. The exact steps that Alex Hormosy lays out in $100 million offers. Great.

###  [Decoupling Personal Brand from Content Delivery](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9e165fa7-95f0-4756-921a-320e7189c261) 

🎧 08:11 - 08:57 (00:46)

The speaker aims to decouple the value provided to the audience from their personal presence on camera by launching a daily productivity email newsletter with a hired writer. This approach allows for the creation of assets and delivery vehicles for courses and products that do not rely on the speaker's direct involvement, presenting a challenge that the speaker is seeking to address.

#### 📚 Transcript

And

B, more broadly, how do we decorulate

the value that we're giving to our audience from me personally sitting in front of a camera and filming? So one thing that we're trying to do is we've just launched a daily productivity email newsletter modeled after Reinholt-Holliday's Daily Stoic where I've started off by giving the broad brushstrokes of what I want this newsletter to look like. But we've hired a writer to write it. And it's got like 10,000 subscribers on it now. And that thing is growing. And that

means every day the writer can write productivity advice that

I can contribute to, but it's not directly tied to me. And so what we're trying to do is how do we build assets and how do we build kind of delivery vehicles for our courses and products that do not require me to sit in front of a camera? And that's a real challenge. So how are you guys solving that challenge right now?

###  [Growing Email List Through Video Content](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cb81843d-b090-4b8c-bb4b-fb8955a2dcff) 

🎧 11:58 - 13:27 (01:29)

The speaker strategically promotes their email list in every video using lead magnets like a Google sheet template, resulting in 50,000+ subscribers from one video. They also mention the newsletter in the middle of the video, leading to a significant weekly increase in subscribers. Despite focusing on organic YouTube traffic, they are also working on improving SEO to grow their email list.

#### 📚 Transcript

We try and plug the email

list somehow in every video. So in the middle of the video, in our sort of video production checklist, we have a checklist that says, Have we plugged the email list? So either we'll do that through a lead magnet. So let's say it's a video about how I manage my time. I'll be thinking when I'm making the video, what is the freebie I can give away with this? So one of our most successful lead magnets was just a Google sheet template that I made that Bob actually made, which was very kind of a I sort of use a Google sheet as my annual calendar. And I just said to Bob, Hey, can you turn this into a pretty version that we can just, you know, let people download. And so we just have this as a Google sheet link.

And I think we've added

50,000 plus subscribers to our email list from one video because people were like entering the email address to get the link to the Google sheet. And then we give them the opt-in. Would you like to sign up to the newsletter? So the little things like that and occasionally will sometimes just say in the middle of a video, Hey, by the way, if you're enjoying this video so far, then I'd love for you to check out my weekly email newsletter Sunday Snippets. It's a very short email that I send every Sunday. And it's got a few thoughts and, you know, some things I've enjoyed reading or listening to, basically copying what Tim Ferriss says for five bit Friday.

Head over to www.aleo.com forward slash Sunday and you can sign up complete for free and subscribe whenever

you want. So I'll just say that in the middle of a video. And then we'll just get like, I don't know, a thousand to five thousand subscribers every week coming in.

That's crazy. Everyone has their own angle. I, you know, I have a friend. I mean, he's got like a million subs on his email. And it's all driven through SEO. And yours is all, that's organic, right? And yours is all organic YouTube, basically. Yeah, we're working on SEO, but we are slowly. So

you're getting there.

###  [Utilizing Email Marketing for Revenue Generation](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c4ba5d52-383d-40f7-9617-5a52c1bdaaae) 

🎧 13:27 - 14:54 (01:26)

The main driver for revenue is the email list, as it serves as a bridge between content and products. The speaker prefers using email to promote free educational courses and attract subscribers, thus leading to revenue from course sales. Initially, launches were done through email for live cohorts, but now an evergreen model is preferred. Daily emails are sent to provide value with an offer at the end, and future plans include launching a new productivity course with a waiting list and early discount strategy. The speaker dislikes live cohorts for online courses and has been influenced by the book 'Oversubscribed' for launch-based product marketing.

#### 📚 Transcript

I don't even consider SEO right now. You're good on all the other stuff. So is the email the main driver for your revenue right now? Are you pushing them to like buy or

is it like pushing them to a webinar? Like, how does that sequence work? Yeah. So the email is the bridge between our content and our products.

What we've realized is

that, or rather, what I've realized is I don't really like selling on my YouTube videos. I don't really like saying, Hey, I've got a course by my course, blah, blah, blah,

because that just feels a

bit, a bit weird.

But I have no qualms with saying, Hey, join my email list or get my free seven day email educational course or whatever. And now they're in our list and they've opted in. And now I have no qualms with us sending the emails.

And so like

the vast majority of revenue from our courses has come as a result of sending emails to the list.

You're doing launches? Like how are you doing

that? Yeah. So back when our YouTube Academy was a life cohort, we did eight life cohorts. Uh huh. We would have, we would do launches through the email list. Yeah. Now we switched to an evergreen model because I hate life cohort courses. So we've just gone self-paced with that, but we still have an email list for that. And Yaka, but marketing guy is doing kind of daily emails that are providing loads of value with an offer at the end. And when Black Friday is going to roll around, I'm sure we'll do something there. We're going to launch a new productivity course. So we're going to sort of get loads of people onto the waiting list and then give them an early discount and just, you know, do sensible things. Uh, Daniel Priestley's book oversubscribed was also a big Bible in terms of how to do launch based in for product marketing.

Got

it. And

you said you hate live cohorts. Why? So a standard online course, uh, I think Mook is what they call, Emma, we'll see. I don't know what it stands for.

###  [Challenges of Live Course Launches and the Appeal of Evergreen Courses](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2937f91b-4711-496a-bd31-e4d9b46f1a75) 

🎧 16:57 - 18:03 (01:06)

Running live course launches requires continuous effort to convince people to sign up, leading to stress, burnout, and a never-ending cycle. Despite high completion rates, the stress and burnout rates are also high. This led to the decision to transition to evergreen courses to avoid the stress and constant cycle of launches. Additionally, the idea of selling courses as perceived progress may not align with the speaker's beliefs.

#### 📚 Transcript

But then we

felt like we had to work harder and harder to convince people to sign up to the course. And that just felt

kind of not nice. It's not nice to feel like you're the seller in a transaction. And so we decided two years in that, you know what, this is good money, but it's not worth it anymore. It's not worth the stress, not worth the headache. It's not worth the headspace that it. It takes to run live cohorts. Let's just turn it into

an evergreen course. So I hate launches. And so internet marketing world is used to doing launches, right? And it's like you do the launch and then everyone's like super strats like you feel relieved. But then you have to get ready for the next launch and then the next. And then it's like you're on this never ending hamster wheel. And then people just burn out, right? But the thing with the live cohort too, it's like sure your completion rates might be 98%. But like your burnout rate, your stress rates a lot higher. So you might as well just go like sure evergreen like when we used to sell courses, we were sending this one boardroom. And one of the guys stood up and he's like gentlemen, we sell courses because courses are perceived progress. People like perceived progress. Everyone was clapping. I was like, okay, that's an interesting way to look at it. I don't necessarily agree with that.

###  [Low completion rates in paid courses and products](https://share.snipd.com/snip/98802261-03c7-4ee9-b429-0422aa8e155b) 

🎧 18:12 - 19:34 (01:21)

Only 60% of people submit the first week homework assignment in a live course that charges between 1500 and 5000 dollars. By week six, the completion rate drops to 15%, despite the course offering accountability, live support, and a money back guarantee. A similar trend is seen with the purchase of products like Peloton, where many people don't even unbox the item or use it after fulfilling an emotional need.

#### 📚 Transcript

How

are you seeing it? Yeah, I mean, honestly, even with our live, you know, we would charge somewhere between 1500

and 5000 depending on which product they were getting. 60%. So only 60% of people would submit the first week homework assignment. Oh, wow. And by week six, we were down to 15% completion rate. And this was of course people have paid thousands of dollars for. It's a live course. There is accountability. We hop on a call with anyone at the drop of a hat. We have a no questions asked money back guarantee. And yet half of the people don't even submit the first homework assignment. What?

Yeah. At

one point, I sort of realized, you know what, I'm not going to stress out about the fact that some people are not going to take the course. It's totally fine. I've bought loads of courses that I've never taken. I've never even opened them. I've never even logged in. It's fine. Maybe I'll get to it at some point. I was speaking to another friend who does marketing and he said, you know, probably half the people that buy Peloton don't even unbox the bike.

That's true. I bought Peloton for like two weddings, right? Like I was

like, where else the best man or whatever else? Like, I got to make it a good gift, right? And I look at their accounts now. They haven't logged in for like two years. Right? And so I'm like, God, what a waste of money. It's like you try to do something nice. And it's just like, anyway. But so the thing this marketing friend said is that people, like a lot

of people will buy a product to fulfill an emotional need. And once they fulfill that emotional need, they feel like they've gotten the value from it. And sometimes they won't even open it. And that's OK. I still

feel kind of weird about

it.

###  [Entrepreneurial journey and focus on business growth](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0078d35d-881d-4dee-87aa-f06210920685) 

🎧 25:48 - 27:01 (01:12)

The speaker learned web design and started affiliate marketing at a young age to make money on the internet. They later succeeded in launching a business to help people get into medical school. Despite a phase of playing video games, they continued to dabble in web design to afford their gaming subscription. Currently, the speaker is focused on understanding the bottlenecks to their business growth and setting priorities, inspired by a recent video on business success.

#### 📚 Transcript

But one has to ask at age 13, like, what was going on in your head to sign up for these? Oh, I was trying to make money on the internet. So I taught myself a freelance web design. I made like a niche affiliate marketing site. Yeah. I tried to make like a

pyramid scheme. I was doing like a bunch of random PHP and

MySQL coding for like small businesses and trying to sell it for $5 a pop.

I was desperate to make money on

the internet. So I started around 12, 13 and then age 19 was when I launched my first business that actually succeeded. And this was a business that was helping people get into

medical school. I love

it. OK. So when I was nine years old, I started a website and then I got distracted by games. So all I did was play video games from like, you know, 10 years old until like 22 years old or so.

I was playing World of Warcraft three hours a day from 14 to 17. Oh, wow. OK. Yeah.

But at the same time, I was also just like doing Dabbling with freelance web design because I was like, oh, my God, I'm making money

and I can afford my wild subscription. fee of $9 a month. OK. I love it. What are you focused

on right now? Mate, I was watching a

formosies recent

video on the plane here yesterday. I think it's titled

something like how to get so rich. It makes you sick. And his one of the

one of the things I wrote in my journal was what are the bottlenecks to our business growth and what are our priorities. So it's funny that you guys have that question. I think for

us are partly partly the bottling depends

on what

the goal is.

###  [Maximizing Revenue through Productivity Courses and Upselling](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4f5380de-4722-4523-a257-d5b662bd80fb) 

🎧 30:32 - 31:48 (01:16)

Selling one-time courses to establish customers and then upselling them to a higher ticket, one-on-one coaching service. Considering pricing the productivity course at $2.99 or $2.97 and offering voice-enabled AI-enabled journaling type product as a co-founder. Exploring the idea of acquiring equity stakes in companies for promotion and building partnerships with existing products. Nathan Barry believes that acquiring equity stakes in companies will be the strategy for billion-dollar creators to maximize revenue over time.

#### 📚 Transcript

You're

selling one time courses here. Oh, and then like these people are buying, they're all now customers, right? And then you can upsell them. Okay. So that's what we're working on. So I'm going to make a productivity course. It's probably going to be about $2.99 or $2.97 with maybe a higher ticket, one on one coaching on the back end. Yeah.

Yeah. And then I'm sure you've probably thought about this already, but it's like productivity people like to waste money on apps. I certainly do. I spend money on a bunch of like you made a short on this one sec thing. I automatically paid for it. Yeah. Like I signed up for an end page for it, right? It's like $10 or whatever. You can do a bunch of these all day. Yeah.

I mean, in fact, you can go buy a bunch of these that already have users already. Yeah. That's another thing that we are sort of working on. I've reached out to a couple of companies whose products are used to be like, hey, can I take equity in your business in return for promo? We're also I'm also building something with a friend. That's a sort of voice enabled AI enabled journaling type thing, which I'll be a co-founder in. So we're

slowly dabbling in that space. There you go.

Do the hormones model, but for productivity. Yeah, like that. That's my opinion. That's an acquisition of a different. Yeah.

Yeah. That's what I had Nathan Barry on the pod the other day. He came to London and we hung out a bunch. And he was he was so bullish on the thesis that like the billion dollar creators are the ones who are going to be acquiring equity stakes and companies. I think that will be

you. So it will take time. Yeah. As long as it

feels good. I think a big part of of my thing is that.

###  [Content Creation Strategy Insights](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fe8ba348-89ff-49fa-a97e-45972964199e) 

🎧 41:44 - 43:09 (01:25)

The speaker discusses their content creation strategy, sharing that they condense a whole week of filming into an eight to ten minute video. This approach reduces pressure on each individual day and prevents the feeling of scraping the bottom of the barrel for content. They also prefer a combination of direct camera and someone following them around for vlogging, and emphasize the importance of content feeling good as the guiding philosophy for their creative process.

#### 📚 Transcript

Yeah work day sometimes personal stuff you

know if Bob's around will feel she'll be like hey Ali can you do an intro for the vlog and I'd be like hey vlog you know just about to have lunch with Eric and Saha it's gonna be good we're gonna do podcast blah blah. And we've got like a time-lapse setup over there so you know Bob will get the footage from the time-lapse and if you guys could send us a photo from here as well. Yeah for the splice bits and bobs of the podcast. Yeah. Be like check out the podcast and look up and it'll splice into like a 10 eight to 10 minute edit.

Yeah I saw the this is Steve I really like Steven's vlogs it's like a combination of him like just going direct a camera with his phone and then someone following him around I believe like that's the best combination because like

I don't want someone in my bedroom you know like so so why

don't I mean you know depends on who right but you know for his it's like it's the entire day and it's like what it's like an eight hour day basically right getting condensed and that's like a six hundred dollars for eight hours. Yeah so we do as a whole week so Marvel

film stuff on and off for the whole week and

then that will be condensed to an eight to ten minute video. Okay oh that's good yeah so it means there's less pressure on each individual

day like

a year ago two years ago we tried doing a daily vlog

that was hard because for the first three days I had stuff to say and then day four I'm like well I'm sitting in the office writing my book and I have nothing to say. Yeah it doesn't feel good. It felt like trying to scrape the bottom of the barrel every time. Yeah I'm going to use the saying

this feels good. It's just ticking man. Yeah it's starting to stick to me as well. I think

this is it. Yeah this is the guiding philosophy does it feel good. Yeah

I love it.
