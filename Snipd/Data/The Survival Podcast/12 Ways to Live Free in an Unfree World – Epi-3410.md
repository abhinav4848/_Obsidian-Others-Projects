###  [Self-Education and Continuous Learning](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9fd189c6-55dc-40af-95e7-523ac9962600) 

🎧 01:10:27 - 01:11:48 (01:21)

Traditional education may not focus on true learning but rather on training individuals. It is crucial to be self-educated and learn something new every day. The value of time is emphasized, urging individuals to make the most of each day. Encouraging self-education for both individuals and children, advocating the shift from 'I can't' to 'how can I' mindset.

#### 📚 Transcript

Does that sound familiar? Just because they teach you reading, writing and math and all the woke ideology they're cramming in you now and a little bit about history, revisionist as hell, by the way. Doesn't mean they actually are teaching you. They're training you and giving you the data that you need to be trained. I can't train you to obey things I send you in writing if I don't teach you how to read. Yeah, real, real simple. So become self-educated. And I mean, every day, if you don't learn a new thing, you've wasted that day, you've wasted a piece of your dash. Remember the dash gets shorter every day, every year, every month, every

decade.

The days are along with the years are short. I'll keep saying it until it goes into every head. Then remove your children from government schools and teach them to self-educate as well. I will right now say, I know that whenever I say this, I get a bunch of people that say, but I can't. First of all, the next one has to do with starting to say, how can I versus I can't? Alright? So if you're not asking every day, how can I? You'll never find an answer to how you can. And you probably can't. But maybe you shouldn't. I'm not here to tell you what to do.

###  [Prioritize Child's Needs Over Bureaucracy](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e57fe7ab-a1f1-4b60-a2ab-d921a7185f85) 

🎧 01:14:20 - 01:15:41 (01:20)

Prioritize your child's well-being over the bureaucratic constraints of the education system. Stand firm in making decisions that are in the best interest of your child, whether it's keeping them home when needed, taking them on a family vacation, or challenging the system that values attendance numbers over actual learning. By advocating for your child and prioritizing their needs, you can ensure they receive a quality education focused on their growth and development as lifelong learners.

#### 📚 Transcript

But I'm like, if the kid is sick and I believe he needs to be home, he's my kid, I will keep him home. And he gave me a bunch of rigor, Maro, and we never had to actually deal with it. But I was like, I'm not doing this. And I told him for us. I said, if I decide that I'm taking my kid out of school for a week because I'm taking him on a family vacation, I'm taking my kid where I want to. And you can go screw it. And I did put it that way. And again, I think because I did it that way and we were so early into this, never had to deal with anything. It kind of shut it down before it started. It was the initial stages. But now, it doesn't fucking true an officer to your house. And I can't do that if your kid is not in their school system. But why do they do that? Because the state apporeses money to each school and district based on how many bodies are and how many seats how many days a year, and when that accumulates, they get less money. So I'm just saying, instead of a couple of days, let's just do the whole damn thing. Because they're not teaching your kids. They're not enabling your kids to be lifelong learners. They're not putting the best interests of your child first. They are following the conformity of the bureaucracy that pays their salaries. And that is not a way to education next generation.

###  [Economics as a Law](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3de503f0-5f11-43b7-9a3c-06670fd1dc6f) 

🎧 01:16:45 - 01:18:10 (01:24)

Economics is likened to a law similar to the laws of physics and cosmology, where attempts to control it are limited. Taxation and interest rate changes influence private solutions, demonstrating the law's real and inevitable nature. The scarcity of certain coins over time exemplifies economic laws, showing that economics operates as a law, akin to gravity, beyond individual actions or equations.

#### 📚 Transcript

It's like trying to control space in the orbit of a plant. It's going to follow certain rules in the laws of physics and cosmology. And it's going to orbit. You're not going to change it. No more than you're going to change how people behave with your money. The more you tax money, the more if it goes underground. The higher you raise interest rates, the more people seek private solutions. The aggressive law is real. That's why you can't find a silver quarter in circulation for shit today. 1980s, we found them all the time. Now, maybe you'd go through 50 quarters to find one, but if you went through 50 quarters, you're probably going to find at least one. I remember back in age, we'd go to the bank and buy like two or three rolls of quarters. Go through them and find half a dozen silver ones. Put them aside, roll them back up, take them back to the bank. And we got the silver quarters for a quarter of peaks, is effectively what was happening there. Do that today. Go through a thousand rolls of quarters. You might find two. Maybe. You might find none. I can't look. You can find ten, but it won't be like it was back then. Because economics is a law. It's not a theory. It's a law. Real economics. It's like gravity. It doesn't matter who did what fucking equation to prove it.

###  [Economics and Gravity: Immutable Laws](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c4db4669-77e6-4d0a-a372-ed81e64b0d9d) 

🎧 01:17:24 - 01:18:51 (01:27)

Economics and gravity are immutable laws. They operate irrespective of personal beliefs or endeavors to control them. Just like gravity, economics function on their own terms, not caring about individual perceptions or interventions. Attempting to defy these laws only leads to harsh lessons and highlights the futility in trying to alter their course.

#### 📚 Transcript

I remember back in age, we'd go to the bank and buy like two or three rolls of quarters. Go through them and find half a dozen silver ones. Put them aside, roll them back up, take them back to the bank. And we got the silver quarters for a quarter of peaks, is effectively what was happening there. Do that today. Go through a thousand rolls of quarters. You might find two. Maybe. You might find none. I can't look. You can find ten, but it won't be like it was back then. Because economics is a law. It's not a theory. It's a law. Real economics. It's like gravity. It doesn't matter who did what fucking equation to prove it. It doesn't matter if it's curved space or not. Gravity itself is a law that doesn't give a fuck what you think. Go throw some shit off a roof and you'll see it in action. It doesn't care. Go up onto a roof. Decide you don't believe in the law of gravity and jump the fuck off. Mind there is no productive individual below you before you do it. Because you're about to learn a hard-ass lesson. Gravity does what gravity does. Economics do what economics do and people do what people do. And you cannot control it. And I believe you can as an illusion and only psychopaths, sociopaths and megalomaniacs believe otherwise.

###  [Taking Control and Creating Solutions](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0a6595b2-d065-45da-9692-20a07b8dba7b) 

🎧 01:21:51 - 01:23:14 (01:23)

Decide not to get stuck in unproductive situations. If faced with obstacles, assess if it's worth your time and effort. Instead of making excuses, focus on finding solutions. Break down challenges into manageable steps and tackle them one by one consistently. Develop a proactive mindset by taking small actions daily to solve problems and achieve your goals.

#### 📚 Transcript

I just know what I'm dealing with now. And I'm not in the business of driving into the mud and then complaining about being stuck. I don't do that. I just don't know in the mud. You showed me that you're the mud I'll take my truck elsewhere. You're not worthy of my time and my contributions here. Because you could have done something and you did nothing. You looked for another reason. So assuming that's not your problem, assuming you really believe that there are things that you cannot do that you want to do because the government says you can't. That's what I need you to do. And if it's like, but I don't have enough money, how can I get enough money? Every day for 14 days consecutively. One thing at a time. Make it easy for you. You get up in the morning, take a crap, have a shower, take a walk, drink your coffee. Drink your coffee on the way to work if you still have a job. And you probably do if this is your problem. Because as soon as you start running a business, you start solving problems like this. Because you realize, so no, no, I was going to fix this. Fuck. I gotta do it. Who do I ask if it's okay if I do it? No one? Shit. I better get on it, right? So your mind switches. That's why one of the steps is in front of business. But all the way to work, how can I mentally play it out?

###  [Focus on One Task at a Time, Problem-Solving Mindset, Strategic Approaches](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0130d224-be45-4ddf-a5db-4bf1dbf5f73a) 

🎧 01:22:34 - 01:23:56 (01:22)

Focus on completing tasks one by one to simplify your day and enhance productivity. When running a business, problem-solving becomes crucial, encouraging a shift in mindset to take immediate action. Embrace strategic thinking by mentally simulating scenarios, seeking guidance, and finding innovative solutions to navigate challenges in profitable ventures.

#### 📚 Transcript

One thing at a time. Make it easy for you. You get up in the morning, take a crap, have a shower, take a walk, drink your coffee. Drink your coffee on the way to work if you still have a job. And you probably do if this is your problem. Because as soon as you start running a business, you start solving problems like this. Because you realize, so no, no, I was going to fix this. Fuck. I gotta do it. Who do I ask if it's okay if I do it? No one? Shit. I better get on it, right? So your mind switches. That's why one of the steps is in front of business. But all the way to work, how can I mentally play it out? If you listen to my podcast, don't stop listening. I need you to listen. Listen to 10 minutes. Hit pause. Ask the question. Think for 30 seconds. Turn the show back on. Let me prod your mind even if I'm talking about making tomatoes or something. It'll work. Trust me. Ask me how I know. How can I get around it? I've gotten around so many things. And I'm not talking about getting away with. I'm talking about getting around. Getting away with means I figure out a way to do it. Well, they don't see it. And even though I'm not supposed to do it, I get away with it. I'm okay with that. I think it's a fine strategy, especially, let's say the thing that you're doing is a profitable venture.
