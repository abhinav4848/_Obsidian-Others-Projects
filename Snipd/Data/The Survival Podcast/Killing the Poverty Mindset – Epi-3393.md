###  [The Importance of Building Wealth](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fccc624c-070e-4c25-8d7f-bb3bd500a56a) [[Processed]]

🎧 02:26 - 02:50 (00:23)

Building wealth is the ultimate preparedness topic. While a rich person losing their house is unfortunate, it's even worse for those who are poor. The more wealth you have, the better prepared you can be for any disaster.

#### 📚 Transcript

I don't think there's a bigger preparedness topic than building wealth. Whenever there's a disaster, even in really bad scenarios, a rich dude losing his house sucks, but a poor person losing their house always sucks more. The more wealth you have, the more you can prepare.

###  [Defining Wealth and Poverty Consciousness](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d23f9c4c-9a8f-4560-b2c7-091089bfd35d) 

🎧 10:32 - 11:57 (01:25)

Wealth is often misunderstood. People with a poverty consciousness may criticize others for their wealth, claiming they are too ignorant to manage it. However, this tough-love approach is necessary to inspire change. The definition of wealth, according to Buckminster Fuller, is based on time forward, a concept he embedded in the language through his inventive work.

#### 📚 Transcript

Even people that have the problem that we're trying to get rid of today, poverty consciousness, they would say no, that person's not really wealthy. They might say they shouldn't be wealthy, but they're too stupid to be wealthy because they have this incredible income that they don't know how to manage. Correct. You're right. And a person that's poor and saying, look at them. See how stupid they are. You're just as stupid. I'm sorry. This is not going to be soft. Nice Jack today. I'm not going to be coddling anybody, not that I'm known for doing that as it is, but I'm going to be a little bit more macho man's savage elbow in the forehead today off the top row than maybe I usually am. Because if you have this problem, you need to hear it that way because anything less just gives you permission to stay comfortable in your misery. So to me, and I'd love to hear from some people here in the comments and the live comments because there's over 50 people now and they keep coming in and number keeps going up. How would you define wealth? Try to drill it down into like one or two sentences for me. Maybe I'll read a few, but go ahead. Put them in and I'll tell you how I define wealth. I define wealth based on Buckminster Fuller's definition of wealth. I define wealth in time forward. So this is a weird thing. Buckminster did weird things and in a patent on a geodesic dome. He buried into the language his thoughts on wealth just because that's the kind of guy he was.

###  [Think Big, Take Action, and Believe in Your Goals](https://share.snipd.com/snip/df967801-1ace-4388-823d-55beccabf61c) 

🎧 01:12:13 - 01:13:38 (01:25)

Believe in your goals, even if others may doubt you. Visualize your success and take actions aligned with your beliefs. Have a growth mindset, never stop learning, but remember to take action. Your mindset and thoughts can subconsciously influence your actions and outcomes. Think big, take action, and believe in your goals, while constantly seeking knowledge and applying it to achieve meaningful results.

#### 📚 Transcript

When I first started survival podcast, I didn't even tell my wife I was doing it for several months because it was just kind of a hobby in my car. Real quick, I figured out I was going to make it a success. So if I only tell my wife about it, show her it. Oh, this is cool. What are you going to do with it? I'm going to start monetizing it a few months. She goes, you know how? I'm like, yeah, I don't know. She goes, could you do it now? I'm like, yeah, but it's not ready yet. Said, that doesn't sound like you. You got to trust me. OK, this is the wonderful life that I have, you know. But she said, well, where do you think this is going? And I said, well, for instance, I'll be on the Glenn Beck show. She goes, what? I said, I'll be on Glenn because Glenn Glenn Beck was kind of big in the space of the time. And she said, you think so. I see. Yeah. She was having to get there. So I don't know. I don't even care. Doesn't even matter. About a year and a half later, phone ranks, Glenn Beck show who want to have you on a show. You might not think that that belief is attached to that result. But if you don't think there are even on some subconscious level things I was doing, moving me in that direction, just because I had that as a thought and you don't understand how the human mind works. Absolutely don't aim too small. Be a lifetime learner, crave and seek knowledge, but never let it replace action. If you listen to me, that's great. But if you don't apply what I'm telling you, it's wasted. Why do you think I don't want to be a consultant? If I do this and I make it scalable and all of you can hear me, it's your choice.

###  [Integrity as the Core Brand and Core Values](https://share.snipd.com/snip/02e9e162-c317-443f-8afb-31d19a8ef11e) 

🎧 01:15:26 - 01:16:48 (01:21)

The speaker emphasizes the importance of integrity as the core brand, stating that they prioritize integrity above being liked or perceived as right. They stress the need to define and publicize one's gauge for integrity, and to incorporate core values into the company culture by openly displaying them and ensuring employees are familiar with and exemplify these values.

#### 📚 Transcript

Some of them might even be out of the 10 commandments, not like not lying and not committing murder, right? But there's usually be able to completely and clearly define what is your what is your gauge for integrity? I've always said my goal for this show, if it's one word brand to be integrity, that you might hate me, you might think I'm an idiot, you might think I'm wrong, but you do not ever, ever think I'm misleading you or lying to you. Or I'm shilling something just to make money, like integrity is my core brand. You need that too. And then you need to not be afraid to be clear about it and public about it. If you have a company, put your core values on your website, read them every day. I would if I had employees, which I don't want anymore, I did this when I had employees. Here's our core values memorizing. Week later, what's core value three? You don't know. If you don't know the next time I ask you, you are fucking fired because you can't work here and exemplify the core values of this place. If you don't know what they are, when I was an army, we had three general orders. General order number one, I will guard everything within the limits of my post and quit my post only when properly relieved.

###  [Excuses vs Reasons](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ac5fd645-27a7-4da1-ba9a-dc528cc6be13) 

🎧 01:21:09 - 01:22:09 (00:59)

Lack of success is not due to reasons, but excuses. Reasons are external factors beyond your control, like the weather. Excuses are internally driven, reflecting things you could have done but didn't. Most self-justified 'reasons' are actually excuses. This distinction forces accountability for one's failures.

#### 📚 Transcript

You have no reasons for any lack of success in your life up to this point. It does not meet your expectations of where you're supposed to be in life. You have no reasons. All you have are excuses. There's no reason. A reason. Like if you ask me, well, why is the ground dry? It didn't rain. Yeah, that's a reason. Why did the government get to go? That's a reason. Why did the garden die? It didn't rain. It's an excuse. You didn't turn on the fucking irrigation. There was something you could have done that you didn't do. That's an excuse. That's a difference in excuse and a reason, a reason as there was literally nothing you could do. 90% of what people convinced themselves are reasons are actually excuses. Excuses are like assholes. Everybody's got one and they all stink. That's the truth. That's a hard truth. And it's a hard truth because it requires you to look in the mirror and say, hey, asshole, this is all your fault.

###  [True mentorship brings real success without a price tag](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e445cb76-cb3d-4bd9-a2c4-2a2e4ba20a8e) 

🎧 01:29:47 - 01:31:12 (01:25)

Real mentorship leads to success by staying true to what you really want, being resilient, and building redundancy. Beware of those who promise success for a fee. Success is achievable without spending on expensive programs. Everything you need to know about success is freely available, and true value-for-value exchange is appreciated.

#### 📚 Transcript

If they do that for you and you haven't short sold yourself on what you really want and you have resiliency and redundancy built into it, you're a success. And it doesn't matter what I think. That's real mentorship. You can't sell that. Stay away from those people. I'll make you successful for $5,000 a month. No, they won't. No, they won't. Now it might work. Air quotes work, right? And that since you're so invested, you're spending the money. You feel like you have to do the things so you do the things, but you could have kept the money and done the things, but you didn't. And nothing these people teach is publicly available. None of it.

Not a word of it.

Everything you need to know about success right now, I just gave you for free. And I will not take any money for it. Though a few of you did send me a super chat T River at $4.99. Thank you. And wave had $49.99, $50. Thank you. I will take that because that's value for value exchange. You decided to do it. I didn't charge you for it, right? Thank you so much for that guys. I really do appreciate it. Cheema Merkel said, I never measured wealth with money. As long as you understand, it takes money to do the things that you're actually measuring, then you're okay. Right. Because that's great. That's great.

###  [Lead with the Benefits](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bcd784a8-d4f8-4130-b224-4ec4b1ad4543) 

🎧 01:32:44 - 01:34:08 (01:23)

When starting a business for a product or service that everyone knows about but doesn't believe can exist, focus on marketing the benefits rather than the product itself. Emphasize the value and advantages that the offering can provide to the customers, and always promote the benefit of what you have, regardless of how well-known the product or service is.

#### 📚 Transcript

Yeah, it's only starting. What you're seeing today is tinders. I'd say by the end of next week, you're going to see full on fires. We well, next week, we're going to be going into the workshop pretty quick, but by the end of next week, you're going to see full on fire. All right. So I do have one question here. Builder of Castles is long ago, five minutes with Jack, the hardest thing to start a business in is something that no one else knows about. What do you do with something that everyone knows and doesn't believe can exist? Not sure exactly how you're asked asking that. I think what you're saying is if you're starting a business for a thing and clear it up for me, builder, if I'm, if I'm missing it here, and it's a new thing and it benefits people, but they don't know about it. Then how do you market that? Feature cell benefits cell. Sell the benefits. Sell the benefits. Don't call it what it is. Say this thing does these things. This service provides this benefit, right? Lead with the benefits. And that's, I don't care if you're selling something that everybody knows about. Always promote the benefit of what you have. So this is something you better be able to do if you want to be successful in business. Okay.

###  [Know the Benefit of What You Sell](https://share.snipd.com/snip/91066ff1-5021-48fd-92e8-36a949cfbc76) 

🎧 01:35:18 - 01:37:24 (02:05)

The key to successful selling is proving that a product works and addressing an actual need or desire. The focus should be on the benefit of the product, not just its features. The benefit should be readily known and effortlessly communicated, reflecting a deep understanding of the business and its value proposition.

#### 📚 Transcript

Because when something really, really works, all you have to do is prove that it works and you're done. And if there's actually a need for it, if there's actually a desire for it, people will buy it, right? But in the end, what you're really selling is the benefit. What is the benefit? Think about how much what I just said about Plexiglas is the benefit versus the features. It's really clear. I don't have to say that. I said to a piece of glass, of course, it's plus glass. It's made out of polycarbonate or whatever the hell it's made out of, you know, synthetic engineers work forever and they turn their propeller hats and they set their little pocket protectors just right and they aligned it with the moon and they mined this out of the earth or whatever it is. 47 machines working, you know, generated, available in sizes, this, that, the other, right? We'll get to that. It's a piece of glass. It doesn't break. Just simple. The value proposition is. Whatever it is that you do, whatever is your business builds, right? Whatever it is. When I say to you, what give me the primary benefits of what you sell? If you have to think for three seconds, you're wrong. You're wrong. Even if the answer is right, you shouldn't have to think for three seconds. It's your business. It's your baby. You better know it's fucking name. Okay. Like you imagine somebody like, and maybe not somebody who like 800 kids, right? You know, because as I age, I realize I start substituting names. A family man, first kid, he's got his baby with him. You know, big enough to maybe walk a little bit with some help and he's kind of kid you carry around. We'll walk up to him and go, what's his name? The guy goes,

um, uh,

uh, Bill, what is wrong with this guy? Is this really your kid? Your business is your kid. You should know its name and its name is its benefit to your customer. If you can't rattle it off without even thinking about it, you have worked to do, even if you know what it is, then you better commit it to memory.

###  [Recognize the Value of Sales Contribution](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fc7a903e-365c-449b-90dc-aa0b0d6db5c5) 

🎧 01:37:39 - 01:39:30 (01:50)

Every employee should recognize the value of the sales team, as they are the ones responsible for bringing in the money that supports everyone in the company. Sales employees are directly responsible for putting money in colleagues' pockets, enabling them to provide for their families. Every employee, regardless of their role, should strive to be a salesperson in some capacity and be knowledgeable about the company's core values and product set.

#### 📚 Transcript

I worked for a company called micro test. That's how I ended up with Luke. Microtuses. Unfortunately, God bought out because I loved working for microtest. Right. I loved it. It's a great company. We had a big end of the year meeting. 500 plus people in this room, plus their spouses and shit for Christmas. Vice president company comes up says, will every person in sales raise their hands? Right. So all of us sales VPs, we ran rep firms. So the reps aren't there. This is employees only. So there's four of us in all country, all four of those hands go up. There's two people that are more like catalog channel sales, those two hands go up. There's my boss and her boss, those two hands go up. And all of us on the outside had an inside sales person. So those four hands go up. So about a dozen people raise their hands out of 500. And the first thing this guy Jim said is, first of all, look at those hands. Those hands feed you. Those hands feed you. When you go home and you open your Christmas presents in a couple of weeks, no, that those hands put the money in your pocket to put those presents in the hands of your kids or put the food on your table or in your refrigerator or pay your mortgage. Those hands did that. I'm not saying anybody in here, what they do is it incredibly important. I'm saying that those people fed you. Then he said, but we should all be feeding in each other. He said every single one of you that didn't put your hands up should be ashamed of yourself. They started looking around at each other like he's like every single one of you should be on some level of sales person for this company. You have no idea who you know or who you don't know. You should know the company. You should know it's core values. You should know the product set.

###  [Leadership is about leading, not pushing](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ba1ebf2d-b1f3-420e-8d69-1a34e90f57c6) 

🎧 01:48:10 - 01:49:10 (01:00)

Success in leading a team is unlimited and prosperous compared to pushing a team, which results in limited and short-lived success. When people feel better after doing business with you, they'll want to continue doing business with you.

#### 📚 Transcript

You build a successful team. You lead a team. You don't drive a team. You don't push a team. You fucking lead a team or your shit. Whatever success you have, you're lucky to have. And it will be infinitely limited and it will be infinitely short. It will run out. Any way it will run out. But if you're a leader and you never take, you'll be infinitely unlimited in prosperity. And that might sound like some Tony Robbins shit or something. It's not. It's just hard facts. Why would anybody not want to do business with you when they feel after doing business with you that they're better for having done business with you? Not like I had to. I guess the legal bullshit I'm dealing with right now. It's not that big of a deal, but it's going to cost me a couple grand. I need it done. So I'll do it, but I have to do it.
