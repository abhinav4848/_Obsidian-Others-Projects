###  [Wealth Tax Impact on Business Owners](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c98901f9-03d2-4698-b67a-ac3e9883b07c) 

🎧 01:00:27 - 01:02:01 (01:33)

- A wealth tax forces business owners to sell shares to pay, reducing their ownership and control.
- This can make them less willing to partner or take risks, hindering growth and innovation.

Jack Spierka explaining how a wealth tax can negatively impact a business owner

#### 📚 Transcript

**Jack Spierka:** And so we're going to tax him on that money. He doesn't have money. He doesn't have money. He has shares in XYZ Corporation. How does he convert those shares into money to pay the tax bill? There's only one way. He has to sell that much stock, plus he's going to have to sell a little more because on the next tax year, he's going to have a gain on his own stock that he sold, and you're illiquidating him, and you're reducing his ownership stake in his own company. What does that mean? That means when he opens his company up to partnership, he's going to be stingier. He's not going to be happy to say, you know what? I'm not talking about a publicly traded company either in this example. Right. You know what? I'm totally OK owning 51% or 52% of my company. I just don't want to lose control of it. I don't care if I partner out 48% of the company, because when it comes right down to it, we have voting shares and we all vote. I will maintain ownership of the company. And that means if I completely disagree with my board of directors, I still maintain control of the company I built. It's a very understandable thing. Sometimes that guy's wrong, but in a free market, he has the right to be wrong and fail. It's his company. He built it. If he's going to make the wrong decision, it's going to hurt. Great. Then he'll learn from that, and either restructure and revamp, or he'll get called out and have to sell out.

🎧 01:09:11 - 01:09:37 (00:25)

- Inflation acts as a hidden tax on wealth by reducing purchasing power over time. 
-  This occurs primarily through the expansion of the monetary supply, effectively devaluing existing currency.

Jack Spierka explaining how inflation acts as a hidden tax.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Jack Spierka:** They took $4,000 of your wealth that year under that 4% inflation, and they did it primarily by expanding the monetary supply. Now, that's one of those big words for some people. They're not real familiar with expanding the monetary supply, what that means. What that means is when they print more dollars, the new dollars have to get value from somewhere. And they don't go out and mine a bunch more gold, stick
