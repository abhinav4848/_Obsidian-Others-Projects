## Snips

###  [Consistency Over Perfection](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3a1ee244-87d9-4664-ac75-d1fb536c7bf0) 

🎧 14:25 - 15:40 (01:14)

In developing a habit like fitness, it's crucial to prioritize consistency over the perfection of the workout. This means giving oneself permission to reduce the scope of the workout if necessary, but always sticking to the schedule. Even on days when time is limited, doing a small part of the workout still contributes to maintaining the habit, which is more significant in the long run than occasional 'good days'. By showing up consistently, even in less than ideal circumstances, one proves to oneself the dedication and maintains the habit, ultimately leading to progress over time.

#### 📚 Transcript

**James Clear:** we can pick a couple different habits, like let's take fitness, for example, and then also do it for like writing and business. So for fitness, which I consider to be this, this is kind of one of like my core habits. It's one of the ones I feel like is most important for how I structure my day. But I try to do whatever I can to reduce friction and make it as easy as possible to do it. So the first thing is I give myself permission to reduce the scope, but stick to the schedule. So if my typical workout takes 45 minutes, but I only have 15 that day, it's easy to get into this story where you're like, I don't have time to do it all. Like why bother? But instead I try to remind myself to reduce the scope, but stick to the schedule. And there have been a lot of days where all I have time for is to go in and do a couple sets of squats. But I'm glad that I did that rather than doing nothing. And it counts for a lot to like not throw a zero up for another day. In a sense, in the long run, I almost feel like the bad days matter more than the good days. Because if you show up on the bad days, even if it's less than what you had hoped for, you maintain the habit. And if you maintain the habit, then all you need is time. So it counts for a lot. You also proved yourself, you know, you can look at yourself in the mirror at the end of the night and be like, you know what? Circumstances weren't ideal.

###  [Reduce Friction to Establish Consistent Workout Routine](https://share.snipd.com/snip/07b5a651-1ba8-4e42-a838-5de1d5646b7d) 

🎧 15:40 - 16:59 (01:18)

The key to maintaining a consistent workout routine is to have the right mindset and approach. By reducing friction, such as setting up workout gear in advance or creating a home gym, it becomes easier to eliminate excuses and seamlessly incorporate exercise into daily life. Additionally, having a strategy and being flexible with the workout scope are crucial for ensuring that even with time constraints, some form of exercise can be prioritized.

#### 📚 Transcript

**James Clear:** Situation perfect, but I still found a way to show up and, you know, like get some reps in today. So that's the first thing is kind of like mindset and approach. Second thing is, and I've gradually increased what I do for this. So I, at first it's, there's basic stuff like set your workout clothes next year, set a mouth the night before, have, you know, everything like ready to go, have your water bottle filled up, stuff like that. But I've gradually kind of reduced the friction even more. And now I used to work at a gym for like 10 years. And so I would do all that kind of stuff. Now over the last year or two, I build a home gym. And so all I have to do is get down to the basement and I can just work out there. And I'm gradually accumulating more and more equipment. You know, I'm becoming like this equipment hoarder. Now I have enough stuff that like, I don't have any excuses. Like all I have to do is just walk downstairs and I can doing that exercise in 15 seconds. So it's really just about reducing friction. Some of that is strategy too. If you don't have equipment or you don't want to pay for a gym membership, there are great body weight programs, or you could just do 10 sprints up and down the sidewalk. And they're like almost no excuses if you have the right strategy for reducing friction and just figuring out ways to get a decent workout. I think the reduction of scope that you mentioned is really critical. That

**Tim Ferriss:** if you don't have time for 60, it doesn't mean you have to go to zero. And I'm guilty of this. This happens to me sometimes, I'm not going to lie. But

###  [Crafting Better Information Flows and Capturing Good Ideas](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8f54b77a-8233-488a-aaf2-281ab9915ed4) 

🎧 22:03 - 23:59 (01:56)

Crafting great information flows and capturing good ideas is key to the creative process. The tool used for this purpose is not as important as the act of capturing raw material to create something great, such as books or newsletters. Ideas are downstream from what is consumed, and the selection of sources influences future thoughts.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Tim Ferriss:** Let's zoom in on the creative process a little bit and we're going to talk about also email lists building email because i feel as though what was old is once new again always it's like every few years i have to be like guys you need a way to communicate with your audience that cannot be taken away from you immediately by a platform. Yeah, email never dies, but everybody talks about how it's dead. Yeah, it's like the cat came back the very next day. We thought it was gone, but it wouldn't stay away. I mean, email is not going anywhere anytime immediately, right? So we'll come back to that because it is a vehicle for transmitting some of this creative work, as you described. I have read a bit about your use or past use of Asana for capturing ideas. I think this was for asymmetry at the time, at least in the article I read on every.to. And then I separately read about a 600-page Google Doc that you had put together and were compressing in various ways. Where have you landed with idea capture, maybe web capture? Let's add that in because it may be a separate category. What is your portfolio

**James Clear:** of tools? First of all, I don't think the tool matters that much. I think what does matter is crafting great information flows and capturing the good ideas that you come across. And then depending on what you're trying to do, in my case, I'm trying to create books or to write newsletters using that raw material that you collected to create something great. So I would say the big picture game is always the same, which is first, I'm trying to craft better information flows. Almost every idea that you have is downstream from what you consume. We don't usually think about it that way, but like when you choose who to follow on Twitter, you're choosing your future thoughts in a sense.

###  [Seeking Book Gems: Open-Mindedness and Networking](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c72f22ef-f3f1-47b2-ad98-9c8afb9e68bd) 

🎧 25:31 - 26:37 (01:05)

To find dense gems in the vast sea of books, it's crucial to be open to quitting a book quickly if it doesn't resonate. Reading with the intent to gather insights rather than for leisure is key. Seeking suggestions from friends and acquaintances on relevant topics can also lead to discovering valuable books.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Tim Ferriss:** do you find the gems that are that dense? I mean, I have my own thoughts on how I approach this, but there are a hundred thousand plus books published a year in the US in English alone, probably something along those lines. How do you ferret your way through the maze to find some of

**James Clear:** those books? First thing is you got to be willing to quit books fast. If you have baggage around finishing books, then if you feel like you have to finish something because you started it, then you're just going to be stuck and you won't move on quickly enough. There's this quote about Emerson, I think, where it says something like, he read like a hawk looking for prey, like scanning over the field. And I think about that, like I try to read like that. I'm not reading for the enjoyment or like slowly unpacking a book the way that I would with a sci-fi novel or something. I'm trying to find, you know, an insight. So that's the first thing is start more books, quit most of them. The second thing is suggestions from friends are always helpful. And so if you let people know, hey, I'm writing about this topic, what's a good book that I should read? I have found a couple of great ones that way. So just kind of putting it out into the universe. If

###  [Optimize for Time and Leverage](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f77773e8-7a7f-4ec0-ab6d-daa20010bb8f) 

🎧 34:25 - 36:07 (01:42)

When running a business, it's important to optimize for time rather than just money in order to spend days as desired. Focus on work that continues to have an impact once it's done, like recorded podcasts, instead of activities with limited immediate impact, such as live radio interviews.

#### 📚 Transcript

**James Clear:** I'll just say, I'm not saying this is how everybody should run their business. It's just how I choose to run mine. And you have to choose what you're trying to accomplish. And in my case, like I don't want to have a big team, but I do want to make as big of an impact as possible. And so the first question I ask is like, rather than optimizing for money, let's optimize for time. So how do I want to spend my days? And then I try to make as few choices as possible that violate that answer. And you got to keep coming back to that. How do I want to spend my days? What do I want my time to be spent on? And within that, how can we reach the most people possible or make the most money possible, but not without violating that? Because there's like all kinds of things you do. You I could staff up, I could build a bigger business, whatever, but like, I'm not interested in spending my days like that. that's the first thing is you got to decide what you're trying to do. A question that I love and I keep coming back to for increasing leverage. And I try to encourage both Lindsay and I to think about this over and over again is what is the work that keeps working for us once it's done? So as an example, when Atomic Habits came out, I did a ton of interviews and some of those interviews were on radio. And I don't really do radio interviews anymore because as soon as I get done with that 10 minute segment or whatever it was, all the work that I put in, vanishes. Nobody's listening anymore. It's off the air. Whereas a podcast like, you know, what we're doing now is being recorded. And so people can continue to listen to it. And, you know, I've done bunch of podcasts for the book and there's somebody somewhere listening to one of them right now. It's almost like there are multiple versions of James out there and they're all continuing to work right now. And that's an example of like the work that keeps working for you once it's done.

###  [Your habits shape your identity](https://share.snipd.com/snip/687f87ea-5e5f-4c32-85ac-8fa04d80cdd3) 

🎧 48:58 - 49:56 (00:57)

Your habits play a critical role in shaping your identity. By consciously choosing the behaviors that align with the person you wish to become, you are essentially casting a vote for that type of person. While habits are not the sole influencer of your identity, their repetition gives them significant power in shaping your story and defining your character.

#### 📚 Transcript

**James Clear:** connects to one of the core ideas in atomic habits, which is your habits are how you embody a particular identity. So the aspects, the behaviors that you perform each day are reinforcing or shaping the story that you have about yourself. I think it's important to ask yourself, like, who is the type of person I wish to become? You know, like, what's the type of identity I want to be reinforcing? And your habits are not the only things that influence that in life. Like, every experience is part of who you are. But by virtue of the fact that they get repeated again and again, they have an outsized influence on your story. And so, you know, the phrase I like to keep in mind is every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. And so as you show up each day and make another YouTube video or do another TikTok video, you're casting a vote for being that kind of person. And if you let the algorithm run it, if you let yourself kind of fall into this, as you said, mask that you're wearing for

###  [Building Lasting Habits through Identity-based Habits](https://share.snipd.com/snip/20b87a1c-5209-46ff-90c0-6fe3e3d66ea8) 

🎧 51:14 - 52:39 (01:25)

To build lasting habits, one must focus on creating a new identity first. Current behaviors are a reflection of one's current identity, so to change behavior, one needs to start believing new things about oneself and build identity-based habits. This process involves deciding the type of person you want to be and then proving it to yourself with small wins. The more small wins and habits you perform, the more evidence you build for that identity, leading to pride in that aspect of your identity. Taking pride in a part of your identity makes it easier to stick with the associated habits.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Tim Ferriss:** I don't think the CCP has infiltrated your website or anything like that. So let me just give this a read. The key to building lasting habits is focusing on creating a new identity first. That's the sentence I'd love to get your take on. Your current behaviors are simply a reflection of your current identity. What you do now is a mirror image of the type of person you believe that you are either consciously or subconsciously. To change behavior for good you need to start believing new things about yourself you need to build identity-based habits would you to add anything to that the creating a new identity first is i think the piece that is of greatest interest to me how would somebody go about doing that let's say they're listening to this. They're just moving into the new year. James, please tell me. Well,

**James Clear:** it's kind of a two step process. Decide the type of person you want to be, and then you prove it to yourself with small wins. And the more small wins, the more small habits that you perform, the more votes that you cast that identity, the more you build up evidence of being that kind of person. And eventually you start to take pride in that aspect of your identity. And man, once we start to take pride in a part of our story, like it's much easier to stick with those habits. If you take pride in the size of your biceps, you'll like never skip arm day at the gym you know so you take pride in how your hair looks you have this like long hair care routine all these hair care habits and you do them every day

###  [Timeless and Fascinating Writing](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f7bf32b0-9fba-45a6-a6f5-9a4afd220671) 

🎧 01:22:35 - 01:23:24 (00:48)

Writing should aim to be universal and timeless, appealing to everyone's habits and interests. This can be achieved by creating content with universal appeal, making it a thing that most people would want. Additionally, writing should be genuinely fascinating to the author, as this passion shines through the writing and resonates with the audience.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Tim Ferriss:** It's like the blog post you wrote that got to the producers for television. Yes,

**James Clear:** right. Similar example. Right. Am I writing something that's pretty universal? So that's another kind of filter for me. Everybody has habits. Everybody's trying to build good habits or break bad ones, even if they're not thinking about it like carefully. It's just kind of part of life. And so not everybody in the world's going to buy the book, but pretty much anybody can look at the cover and be like, yeah, I get why that would be useful. That's a thing that, you know, most people are going to want. So timeless is a universal. And then I feel like you have to pick something that fascinates you because if you're genuinely interested in it, that comes through in the writing. I think Morgan Housel has some kind of line where it's like, writing for yourself is fun and it shows. Writing for other people

**Tim Ferriss:** is work and it shows. And have

**James Clear:** a good BS meter for

###  [Finding the Right Audience for a Book](https://share.snipd.com/snip/676ee5be-b492-4b73-b1fe-17bc623e034d) 

🎧 01:40:37 - 01:41:49 (01:12)

The key is to reach out to people who have opted in and are genuinely interested in the book rather than spamming. Creating a list of potential readers who are passionate about specific communities or topics, such as crossfitters, vegans, bullet journalers, and parenting blogs, can generate word of mouth and help give the book a push. This approach goes beyond targeting individuals with a big audience and focuses on communities with a strong word-of-mouth culture.

#### 📚 Transcript

**James Clear:** Yes. But my thing, again, the same way with like the podcast, I only wanted to do it with people who opted in. I'm not trying to spam people with the book. So again, this takes a lot of effort. Like we had to come up with a list of people who we thought would be a good fit. And then we sent them all messages and said, Hey, I got this book coming out. Would you be interested? If so, what's the best address to send it to?

**Tim Ferriss:** How did you find those people? Who's a good fit?

**James Clear:** So the obvious answer, the one that everybody thinks of is, oh, it's people with a big audience who are interested in the topic that I'm writing about. But I actually think you can do much better than that, which is we made a list. So again, what are we trying to do here? We're trying to give the book a push and help it generate word of mouth. So I think one thing that you could do is say, which communities already have a lot of word of mouth? What are the type of things that people are interested in that they just can't shut up about? And so I came up with a list of things, CrossFitters, vegans, bullet journalers, parenting and mommy blogs. Like I started to write, you know, I just, I came up with a bunch of categories of people who they love to talk about their thing. And so I think I ended up having like 15 categories or so.

###  [Position Yourself for Success](https://share.snipd.com/snip/139b1c77-0045-43bc-be1b-a0d7b282d8cb) 

🎧 02:07:42 - 02:09:33 (01:51)

Design your environment to make good habits obvious and easy while making bad habits less obvious and higher friction. Start by evaluating the spaces where you spend most of your time and make tweaks to support the habits you want to build. By making multiple adjustments across different environments, you create a tailwind for building good habits. Small changes can make a significant difference, so position yourself to succeed by setting up your environment to support your goals.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Tim Ferriss:** You

**James Clear:** can also use the carrots. Like the flip side of that is, so yes, like make it painful not to do it and make it easy and frictionless and obvious to do it. Try to design your environment. So the things that you say are important to you are the obvious available things. I think one interesting thing you can do is just think about one habit you're trying to build and then walk into the rooms where you spend most of your time each day, kitchen, office, bedroom, whatever, and just look around and ask yourself what behaviors are obvious here? You know, what is this space design to encourage? That's And you'll start to notice different things that you can tweak to make it the good habit, more obvious and easier and the bad habits are the things you want to avoid less obvious and maybe a little higher friction and making one or two little adjustments like that is not going to radically transform your life. But if you make a dozen or two dozen or 50, and you're kind of all of these environments, all these rooms where you're spending space each day are primed to support the habits you want to build. Now you've got a tailwind rather than a headwind. And so it's become so much easier to appear as if you have great willpower or that you're really consistent when really you're benefiting from the environment that you already set up. And

**Tim Ferriss:** I'll also say sometimes one or two changes can make a huge difference. Coming back to my brownie binge yesterday, there's a reason I don't cook brownies all the time, right? There's a reason I don't have chips in my house because I will eat all the fucking chips. I will eat everything. I love chips. And I rather than view that as a failing, like, yes, I could take the hard path and like crawl on my knees through broken glass, like develop the willpower to stare at these chips every day and not eat them. Or I can just not have the chips in my pantry. So put

**James Clear:** yourself in positions to succeed. A lot of it is positioning,
