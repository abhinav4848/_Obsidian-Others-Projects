Jocko Willink on the complexity of missions

#### 📚 Transcript

there's two types of complexity that, you know, we could talk about here. There's the actual complexity of the mission, which, again, in generally, is not going to be super complex. But what is complex is yet your dealing with human beings who have, you know, all these variables emotions and problems and issues and egos. And that's the complexity in anything. And so that's, from a leadership to perspective, that's what i've found to be always the more challenging thing, you know, that's always the more challenging thing, is dealing with people and getting people to, you know, conduct operations or carry missions in a way that is most efficient, most effective, especially when you know theycould get killed doing it. And, you know, you're asking guys to do things that are very, very dangerous, where they know they could die. And so that's what's complex. That's what's complexand and it transfers over to the business world, where you've got to get, you know, a group of, it's the same thing. You've got to get a group of people

🎧 46:33 - 48:16 (01:43)

Jocko Willink on defining objectives in a battle.

#### 📚 Transcript

and sustain the morale for that matter, right? And that's, that's actually a simple question. You know, ok, here's what we're going to do. Three days from now, we're gin to go into this neighborhood. We're goin to establish a combat outpost, and that's warkging to folkes on for the next three days. And then once we get that thing established, guess what? Wegring to spend a, you know, four or five days there, and then were going to do it again. And grand picture, you know, strategic vision, here's what its goingto look like. We're going to have combat outposts all over romati that re going to be controlled by americans with iraki soldiers in them that can go out and talk to the local populace, and we can secure the city. So it was, it was as simple as that. Now, you take that down a level to, let's say, my seal platon, one ofmy se platunes, and they'd be saying, ok, here's what we're gong to do. We'ren t going t take this particular building, and then were gong to cover for the conventional units as they come in in a very exposed way, because when you build these combat outposts, you're literally doing a construction project in the middle of a combat zone. Sot ese guys, these brave army engineers are standing with, you know, a hammer in their hand, full body armor and, you know, reinforcing these buildings, loading sandbags, building barricades. And, you know, this is while we're being attacked, well. And so those guy, you know, like i said, i could never give enough credit to the units that we worked there in ramadi. They were phenomenal and brave. And what we would do is, while they were doing those missions, building out those combat outposts, we would go out to the high ground surrounding the combat post. So we'd sneak out into the areas surrounding the combat outpost. So now, when the enemy came to attack the combat outpost, we would kill them, right?

#### 📚 Transcript

I remember there's one scene where where they're walking, youknow, the're walking through the jungle on some islad in the pacific, and nothing has happened yet. And i had that feeling, ecause it's just like the feeling you'd have in romati andou you'd be walking down the street, if, if no shots be fired yet. It's this, it's this feeling of of anticipation,
