###  [Why Being Married Makes Me Happier Than Being Single](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5009ecb4-92af-4e86-8122-70298aab7a07) 

🎧 07:34 - 08:54 (01:19)

The speaker reflects on their preference for being married compared to being single and how it suits their personality. They also mention that there may be other things that make them happier than anticipated. The conversation then shifts to a blog post about dating success and the importance of being relaxed rather than confident. The speaker admits to being out of the dating game for nearly a decade.

#### 📚 Transcript

Hmm. That's hard. That I didn't expect would make because now I have to like go back and like rewind the clock and think, um, I, you know, this is a weird thing. Say, but I really like being married. When I was single, I think there was a lot of, again, the anxiety about like picking the right person, like, you know, okay, like, I'm going to be with this person and you want the relationship to last. And you also see people who have stresses in their relationship. But I'm just, I think my personality is really well suited to being like married as opposed to when I was single. So I just, I enjoy that part. Um, I think what other things make me happier than I anticipated. Um, I can't think of anything right now, but I'm sure there's some that will come up to me later. Yeah.

Feel free to bring them up if it comes back later, because I am interested in that, but you bring up the marriage piece and you have this, you have this great blog post, 18 life lessons for eight, oh, for

your 18 year old self.

And the first one you, you say is you'll have more dating success if you strive to be relaxed rather than confident. And I love that idea. And I think it's so, it's, it's not talked about enough. And it's so true from my experience.

Well, keep in mind, I've been out of the dating game for like almost a decade now.

###  [The Challenges of Expressing Thoughts in Writing](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a26844ef-d99f-495f-af0e-9ddd5155ef84) 

🎧 01:10:51 - 01:12:10 (01:19)

Writing can be challenging because it requires a dual search process. Writer's block occurs when you struggle to express what you know or lack certain knowledge. Unlike conversation, writing often involves the knowledge telling strategy where thoughts are expressed as they come to mind. This can result in jumping around, switching topics, and incomplete points due to limited working memory. However, writing offers the advantage of editing and rewriting, enabling a refined and polished final product.

#### 📚 Transcript

Like, how am I going to present this? And it's this dual search process that's like incredibly taxing. And it's why we have writer's block because sometimes you know something, but you don't know how to express it, or you have a way to express it, but you're missing some knowledge or like, and so you're going back and forth, back and forth, and so even to like just write a really short essay, it takes a lot of work. And so I think one thing that differs from conversation is that what I'm doing right now is a lot more like the knowledge telling strategy. Just because I don't have time to compose. I am just saying things as they come to mind. And so if you transcribe it, it's not going to look that great. I don't think, well, maybe you'll read it and you'll like it. But I think, you know, we're jumping around. We're switching topics. I start a point. I say, well, I'm going to talk about three things that I only talk about one of them, because I have the limited working memory bandwidth. I can't keep track of everything. I am just saying things as they come to mind. Whereas when you're writing, I mean, you can write that way. There is stream of consciousness writing adults often write that way too. But if you're trying to write something good, you're usually trying to be like, well, what's the right way to open this? And what's the right way to explain this idea? This sentence is confusing. How do I say that again? And so it's the fact that you can edit. It's the fact that you can go over and rewrite and change it and think it again. That you just like you have an ability that it's hard to do in, you know, extemporaneous speech where you're just like spouting off because you can edit because you can do that. I think that's really hard.

###  [The Importance of Feedback in Expert Judgment](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f530d25c-f14a-40f2-b099-d279ffa087c8) 

🎧 01:22:25 - 01:24:06 (01:41)

Psychologists relying on their expertise to make parole decisions may not be as accurate as a simple tally of positive and negative factors. The lack of feedback and deliberate practice may hinder their decision-making skills. Perhaps we should consider training experts like athletes to improve their judgment abilities.

#### 📚 Transcript

That's more like, what do people think about this think about this? I'm talking about like, so for instance, like a class example would be like, if you're a psychologist and you're offering like a parole decision, like will this criminal reoffend, right? This is a kind of, it's a task that you might have to do if you were in this sort of setting. And what they find is that if you just like, like listed out their resume of like, and just did a tally of like, this is in their favor, this is against them, and just tallied it up, that actually does better than like three PhD holding psychologists who do like an hour long interview from them, which is crazy, right? Like you think you have a lifetime of experience and all these theories of like, you can't do that. And I think the reason why or the explanation that I draw to there is, is that a lot of practitioners, a lot of like, of these kinds of experts who are relying on like a kind of judgment, they're not getting good feedback from their tasks. So they don't know whether they're making good decisions or not. And then at the same time, you know, what we were talking about, they're like, we're not getting this sort of practice, this deliberate practice where you are, yeah, you're actually like taking time out to hone this skill, you're just doing it, right? So you just you get more and more fluent. This is the flow idea, you get more and more fluent, but you don't get better. So you just become, you could become more and more confident just saying your opinion, but you don't get easier to bullshit. Yeah. And so, so this is a particular class of of expert judgment. And I think the idea is sort of to go back to it, is it like, yeah, maybe, maybe we should be training people more like athletes.
