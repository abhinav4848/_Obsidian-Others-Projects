Joining us for the discussion is someone who's become part of our family. It's Paula Bant.

I'll share my fiery trivia question. Now, the father of stacking Benjamin's our very own Homer Simpson. It's Joe.

Oh, Sal, see ya. I don't think it, Doug. I don't think Doug, have I ever gone. Oh, here's what you do. Donuts. Donuts. Hey, everybody. Happy Friday to you all. I am Joe Sal, see how I ever show money on Twitter or X or whatever we call it today. I can't get the twigs. Now that seems

like the perfect marriage of Twitter and X.

###  [The Influence of Childhood Scripts and Cognitive Biases on Money](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0d2e7c4d-789f-4bd6-b6fd-56c2373f4acc) 

🎧 14:58 - 16:15 (01:16)

Money scripts and cognitive biases learned in childhood can impact our relationship with money. Negative scripts about money can lead to resentment and negative beliefs. Cognitive biases such as negativity bias and loss aversion also influence our thinking about money. Cleaning up these negative influences is important. The conversation also touched on the enjoyment, convenience, socialization, and habit formation aspects of going out to eat.

#### 📚 Transcript

Well, as Elaine said, there are certain scripts that we are taught as children about money. So for example, if we saw our parents fighting about money, we learn money is a source of conflict. And so we start to hate money. We resent money because it is a source of conflict. If we were surrounded by grown ups who told us money is the root of all evil or who associated being rich necessarily with greed, then again, we've internalized these very negative money scripts. And so we have a lot of those scripts, implicit scripts, unwritten scripts from early childhood that permeate into our thinking. In addition to that, we also have cognitive biases. Now, those cognitive biases differ from scripts because scripts are psychological. Negative biases are innate, negativity bias, loss aversion. Those impact the ways in which we think about and handle money that are simply part of the way that our brains are wired. So that's part of cleaning up the pollution in between your ears. And final thing I'll say, going out to eat thing is what strikes me when I'm listening to both you and Len talk, Joe is, you talk about it's fun, that's enjoyment. Then you talk about convenience, right? That's another factor. So there's enjoyment, there's convenience, there's socialization, there's habit formation, right?

###  [The Importance of Time Management](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a24e0ac4-c3b5-41c5-b27c-6be5ee4b37e4) 

🎧 25:37 - 27:08 (01:31)

Spending more money can be beneficial in the long run. Buying quality items that last longer saves money compared to constantly replacing cheap items. For example, ordering in bulk online saves time and money. Time is valuable and should be spent on things we love, like family and self-care. And hey, Doug buys scotch in bulk too!

#### 📚 Transcript

There's lots of reasons why spending more money can help yet. I mean, it's kind of like the old thing with quality over, you know, sometimes like when you're buying products, you want to buy, you'll spend more because it'll last longer. You know, you're buying less of the products over time than buying a whole bunch of cheap things that you have to replace every year, say, you know, that happens a lot with all kinds, especially big ticket items. It's usually worth paying more over the long haul than to pay less and pay more of it over time. So absolutely, that's one way to

help you out. I have a sample. I'm drinking positive energy, tea, and every time I used to go to the local supermarket, they were out of it. And when they had it, it was like double the price, but I went online and I found now I order in six packs, right? And so I don't have to go to the supermarket every time this runs out. And I save about two a month. So I'm saving $10. I don't have to think about having to go and go to the supermarket without that one because they ran out of it. So to your point, Len, we have to be very smart about time because, I mean, time has to do with money. And also we have to make time for the things that we love to do, like being with a family and do an exercise and, you know, feeding our mind.

In the well-being side too. That's funny, Len. You do that with that drink. Doug does that with scotch. Gets them six at a time. And, uh,

Yeah, for sure. True story out of the back of some guys truck at the mobile station on the

corner.

###  [The Importance of Recording Accomplishments and Demonstrating Value](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c87efa78-ec47-4974-a363-85e66d47468b) 

🎧 28:28 - 30:07 (01:38)

Record your accomplishments and value to the company to know your worth. Present this list to your boss to negotiate a raise. Online websites can help boost confidence and determine your true value. Don't be afraid to explore other job opportunities if salary expectations aren't met.

#### 📚 Transcript

Well, the biggest thing, and I tell both my kids this is all year long, you should be recording your accomplishments and your value to the company or your boss or whoever that is. And as you do that, you, you can see your value to the company or you can also see where you're not providing value to the company over time. If you don't have a lot of bunch of bullet points after month three or month four on the job, you better, you should be in trouble. But you put that list together and it makes it so easy. It makes it so easy to go into the boss and just say, boss, I'm worth this, you know, I'm worth this big of a raise. And here's why you hand the paper over to them with the bullet points. And what can they say? That's what I did my entire career. And it was very successful. They really have nowhere to go when you, when you show them what your value to the company. So that's fabulous Elaine. Do you have something else? Yes. So I'm heartedly

agree with you. I can tell you what I did in a personal level because I was a corporate for 20 years and

just as a woman, I mean, Hispanic side, it was hard for me to get promoted.

I was given a lot of bosses given because I wasn't real quick, completely opposite of my physical appearance, of course. So anyway, what I did is I had to create confidence and how I created confidence is I went online and there are a few of the websites that you put all your accolades and your education, your experience. And it tells you how much you're worth. Because sometimes we are our worst enemy, right? And we think, oh, no, we've not worked that much. And with that amount, I mean, that was still not enough. And I'll tell you one specific anecdote, which was I actually said, OK, screw it. If they're not going to increase my salary, I'm going to go somewhere else. So I start interviewing an interview for about 50% more. And I got the offer letter and I talked to my boss and I said, you know, I wish.

###  [The Importance of Value over Fees](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c6c5dcfd-8ae1-471e-aa64-2a66ae09b631) 

🎧 47:40 - 48:55 (01:14)

Our obsession with cutting fees can sometimes overlook the value we receive. Warren Buffett's philosophy of paying for what we get holds true. As an entrepreneur, asking for a discount means asking for more effort with less compensation. When requesting a discount, remember that you're asking for a favor. Don't expect a Rolls Royce for the price of a bicycle. While it's important to consider cost, our first question should be about the value we will receive and if the fee matches that value.

#### 📚 Transcript

It is so interesting to me. Our fixation on fees and Elaine, I mean, cutting fees are definitely important. But sometimes I think, Len's right, we get the cart before the horse there. Yes.

What comes to mind is that game is killed by Warren Buffett. That prices would be pay and values what you get. So there's so much truth to that. I learned this when I was in a W2 anymore because when you have a salary, you know, it's hard to put yourself in the position of an entrepreneur. But once you have a service and you're asking for a discount, you're really asking them to work a little harder for less. But you're expecting the same value. So you have to be careful. I mean, I'm talking up to the end consumer here. When you ask for a discount, you're actually asking for a favor. So be careful. And if you want a Rolls Royce, you got to pay for a Rolls Royce. If you get the price of a bicycle and you expect to know it was, is that unreal?

So I think it's great. Don't get me wrong. Don't overpay. But too often we think, especially money geeks, hey, what do I pay for that? That is our first question. And I think what you're saying is my first question should be, what am I going to get? What am I going to get? And then is the fee commiserate with that?
