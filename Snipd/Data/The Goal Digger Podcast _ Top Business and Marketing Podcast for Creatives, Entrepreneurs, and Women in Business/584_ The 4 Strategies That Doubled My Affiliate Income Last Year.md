###  [Organically Sharing Things I Love and Building Influencer Muscle](https://share.snipd.com/snip/741c6558-8222-4f03-b25d-8be7f8e82ea0) 

🎧 14:14 - 15:34 (01:20)

In the past year, I've focused on sharing things I love without any financial incentive. As influencers, we need to do this to build our authenticity. To double our affiliate income, we went deep instead of spreading ourselves thin. Out of the 30 affiliate programs I'm part of, I realized that 90% of the results came from less than 10% of the programs. So, we decided to prioritize our top partnerships and let go of the rest. I'm still an affiliate for some things, but I'm not heavily focused on those that don't make a significant impact.

#### 📚 Transcript

This is something that i've been really focused on over the last year, is just organically sharing things i love, things that are not hashtag ad or sponsored or tied to any sort of revenue, just letting people in so that they can see i genuinely talk about things i love, regardlessf if i'm getting paid or not. And this is something that i think we have to build our muscle on as influencers. Number two is this. And this, i think, was the secret sauce in us able to double our affiliate income. Go deep, not wide. I've talked about this on the show before, but this is something we did at a high level over the last year. While i'm signed up for or a part of probably over like 30 offiliate programmes as a paying customer, i decidedt really look at what was resinating, what's working, and what's generating results in the form of happy customers and commissions. And when i looked at all the affiliate opportunities, i noticed parado's principle at play here. 90 % of the results were driven by less than ten % of the liat programms. So we decided to drill soup or deep in our top affiliate partnerships and let the rest fall away or shift out of focus. Doesn't mean that i'm not still an affiliate for things, but i'm not focusing heavily on those ones that aren't moving the needle.
