###  [Steve Jobs talks about how to be a creative person in your own way, defined by yourself, as it’s your life.](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6dca134f-fcf7-4393-b71c-31a5f2047553)

1. Steve Jobs viewed work as his life during his early days at Apple
2. Jobs believes his work is still a large part of his life, but not all of it

#### 📚 Transcript

**David Senra:** But this is fascinating because it then leads him to say something about, you know, I've never really thought of my life and my work as different things. And he says, well, we were very young and most of the folks were not married, so they could work 15 hour days. But you didn't have a typical situation where you worked so that you could support your life. Your work was your life in many cases. Then he's asked a follow-up question. Do you feel you've changed from that? Is that your life still? And his response, I feel it is still my life, but it is not all of my life. It's less of a percentage, but I still don't really, and there's a pause, I've never been able to think of my work and my life as different things. They're the same thing. And then he says, as he gets older, now he's a family, he's married, he's got kids. It used to be 99% of my life, and now maybe it's 50% of my life, but he never thought of them as different things. So then he's invited to give a speech at Palo Alto High School, and this is actually for the high school graduation. And I'm just going to read you some highlights here, because I think what happens is he's really highlighting what he feels is actually important in life. And he says, I'm supposed to offer you some wisdom and advice that you may remember along your travels. Be aware of the world's magical, mystical, and artistic sides. The most important things in life are not the goal-oriented, materialistic things that everyone and everything tries to convince you to strive for. Most of you know that deep inside. I bet many of you have had some of these intuitive feelings about what you could do with your lives. We are never taught to listen to our intuitions, to develop and nurture our intuitions. But if you do pay attention to these subtle insights, you can make them come true. People will come at you with reasons why you shouldn't do these things. And so then he gives some positive advice. Be a creative person. Creativity equals connecting previously unrelated experiences and insights that others don't see. And one way to be more creative, he says, is you need to get a more diverse set of experiences. And how do you do that? By not traveling the same path as everyone else. And he continues. So to be a creative person, you have to invest in yourself by exploring uncharted paths that are outside the realm of your past experience. Seek out new dimensions of yourself, especially those that carry a romantic scent. But one has no way of knowing which of these paths will lead anywhere in advance. That's one of the most important lines. There's no way to tell in advance. One has no way of knowing which of these paths will lead anywhere in advance. only thing one can do is to believe that some of what you follow with your heart will indeed come back to make your life much richer. And it will. And you will gain an ever firmer trust in your instincts and intuition. Don't be a career. The enemy most dreams and intuitions and one of the most dangerous and stifling concepts ever invented by humans is the career. A career is a concept for how one is supposed to progress through stages during the training for and practicing of your work life. Many people find what they believe to be safe harbors, like a lawyer or accountant, only to wake up 10 or 15 years later and discover the price they paid. So I just want to pause here interject because I do think I have a unique perspective from like my vantage point here. I obviously know a lot of my friends are lawyers or accountants they're not like, I don't think Steve's picking on those two occupations per se, but I do know a ton of them that feel this way. But I also talked to a lot of founders because of the podcast, right? And you know what a surprising regret is, I think, from the outside? How many of this appears over and over again? Building a big company. You'd be shocked at how many founders start out with a small idea, gets more successful, turns into a big company, and then their business grew so much. And as a result, had to change. And it changed into something that they no longer love or enjoy. We terrible predictors of what we will think humans all humans terribly bad at predicting what we think we actually want will actually make us happy and there's so many conversations where like i cannot believe this like what i thought i wanted what i thought other people told me was successful it's like this giant company by headcount or by complexity or whatever it's like i don't like it anymore so i just want to again not try to tell you what to do obviously I never would just telling you like what other people experience and maybe you know you figure you figure it out for yourself this part is fantastic make your avocation your vocation make what you love your work the journey is the reward people think that you've made it when you've gotten to the end of the rainbow rainbow and got a of gold. But they're wrong. The reward is the crossing the rainbow. That's easy for me to say. I got the pot of gold, literally. But if you get to the pot of gold, you already know that that's not the reward, and you go looking for another rainbow to cross. And so the summary of that paragraph for me is, time the stuff life is made of. Quote from Ben Franklin. That is literally how you spend your time is all that matters. That is what your life is. Think of your life as a rainbow. This is, again, maybe my favorite quote in the entire book. Think of your life as a rainbow arcing across the horizon of this world. You appear, have a chance to blaze in the sky, and then you disappear. What is he saying? Go for it like your life depends on it. Why? Because it does. It literally does. The two endpoints of everyone's rainbow. This is, again, I think he's got a ton of great ideas, right? But something, if you study Steve, what he says over and over again, is like if you need to use your inevitable death as a tool to make decisions on how you're going to spend your time. The two endpoints of everyone's rainbow are birth and death. We all experience both completely alone. And yet most people of your age have not thought about these events very much, much less even seen them in others. How many of you have seen the birth of another human? It's a miracle. And how many of you have witnessed the death of a human? It is a mystery beyond our comprehension. No human alive knows what happens to us after our death. Some believe this, others that, but no one really knows. Again, most people your age have not thought about these events very much. It's as if we And And love the way he ends his speech. Now, as you live your arc across the sky, you want to have as few regrets as possible. Remember, regrets are different from mistakes. Mistakes are those things that you did and you wish you could do over again. In some, you were a fool. He says, usually concerning women. That's hilarious. In some, you were a fool, usually concerning women. In others, you were scared. In others, you hurt someone else. Some mistakes are deep and others are not. But if your intent was pure, then they are almost always enriching in some way. So mistakes are things that you did and wish you could do over again. Regrets are most often things you didn't do and wish

###  [Steve Jobs explain Management by Values](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b83e8a0d-ed20-497c-a104-22933482a453) [[listen later]]

1. Finding great people is the most important lesson in business due to the large variance in quality
2. Great people are often missionaries, not mercenaries
3. Individual contributors can be phenomenal even when management and culture is poor
4. Passion for the company can be a motivating factor for employees

#### 📚 Transcript

**David Senra:** you have in your life. There's a huge variance in the quality of people. You've already experienced that. And so you have to go for great. That's been the most important lesson that I've learned in business, that the dynamic range of people dramatically exceeds things you encounter in the rest of our normal lives. And to try to find those really great people who really, really love what they do. And there's also an element that they're missionaries, they're not mercenaries. And he's talking about this. He's like, listen, when I returned to Apple in 1997, so that'd be six years before he's talking about this, the individual contributors were phenomenal. The individual contributors, right? He thought the management and the overall company culture was terrible. Obviously, you and I talked about this when we went over Johnny Ives' excellent, excellent biography. And so I'm sure Johnny's one of these people. And he says, I asked a lot of these guys, why did you stay? And they said, because we bleed six colors. I heard that from a lot of people. There were six colors in the old Apple logo. So I bleed Apple colors, right? It was management that was a problem. So we actually got rid of most of the management team and promoted a lot of these young people into management positions. This is Steve's very unique perspective on management. And what I found is that nobody in their right mind wants to be a manager. It's true. It's a lot of work and you don't get to do the fun stuff. But the only good reason to be a manager is so some other bozo doesn't be the manager and ruin the group that you care about. And so he continues about management. And this is why I think people love Steve. They just love people that are unfiltered. We all think this, but no one talks about it. We all play this like this fake game with this jargon and pretend like we're not all humans underneath. And so what do you talk about? I study management in school. Like, you know, I agree with what he's saying here. It's basically what I'm saying. There's a lot of management techniques. It's all crock. And a really smart guy I met a long time ago who used to teach at Disney University. Walt Disney himself recruited this guy to run Disney universally, told me about his point of view. Steve has, what, 30 years of, three decades of experience running companies at this point. And he's like, but I like what this guy that ran Disney University actually said. And he says he called it management by values. What that means is you find people that want the same things you want. And so he's going to tell this in an analogy. We're all going to take a trip together. The first thing is to figure out where we all want to go. The worst thing is if we all decide we want to go to different places, you can never manage it. This guy wants to go to New Orleans. You want to go somewhere else. I want to go to San Francisco. You want to go to San Diego. That doesn't work. But if we all say we all want to go to San Diego, that's the key. Then we can argue about how to get there. You think it's better to take a plane. You think it's better to take a train. We'll figure that part out because if I say I want to take a train to San Diego and somebody says that's really stupid, it'll take three days, we can fly and be there in an hour. I'll go, oh, okay, because actually I want to go to San Diego. So if I can get there in an hour flying, I'll ditch my idea about the train. That's what management by values is. It's finding people with passion. There's that word again. It's finding people with passion that want to go to San Diego, who want to go to the same you want to go. That is the key. And then he goes into, okay, now we have agreed to where we want to go. How do we do that? And his whole point is you figure it out along the way. That's what you get paid to do, right? So if you want to preserve something, what you want to do is have a good enough place to go. That's got a long enough focal length that it will survive over time that everybody agrees on and not codify how you're going to get there. And that's one of my mantras around Apple and Pixar, right? Because the people that you recruit, everything, like this is what we just talked about, everything with Steve is going to come to the quality of the people that you have around you. And that's one of my mantras around Apple and Pixar, that recruiting is the most important thing that you do. Finding the right people, that is half the battle. And so based on my understanding of Steve throughout this reading, I think the person that was most influential on how he managed when he came back to Apple was actually the time he spent with Ed Catmull, seeing how Ed Catmull actually ran Pixar. And Ed says something over and over again in his autobiography, Creativity Inc., about this. It's very similar to what Steve's saying here. If you give a good idea to a mediocre team, they will screw it up. If you give a mediocre idea to a brilliant team, they will either fix it or throw it away and come up with something better. And so I think that adds context into why Steve keeps repeating that recruiting is the most important thing that you do. Finding the right people is half the battle. And
