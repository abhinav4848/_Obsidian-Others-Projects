Throughout my story, I will try to return to Brunel and to other designers and engineers to show how identifying with them and seeing parallels with every stage of my own life enabled me to see my career as a whole and to know that it all turned out the way it has by which I am led to believe that in the case of inventors, for vision, one might equally read well read stubbornness. Remember that I am celebrating only my stubbornness. I am claiming nothing but the virtues of a mule. So he talks about why looking up to people like Brunel and Buckminster Fuller and then eventually Jeremiah Fry I think is his name. He switches from art to engineering and this is him talking about not relying on human judgment once more. In art, you place yourself at the mercy of human judgment and its odious courteous, human error and human weakness.

This is what development is all about. Empirical testing demands that you only ever make one change at a time. It is the Edisonian principle, and it is bloody slow. It is a thing that takes me ages to explain to my graduate students at Dyson Appliances. But it is so important. They tend to leap into tests, making dozens of radical changes, then stepping back to test their new masterpiece. How do they know what which change has improved it and which hasn't? There is no, this is really important too, there is no such thing as a quantum leap. There is only dogged persistence, and in the end, you make it look like a quantum leap. While it is easy of course for me to celebrate my doggedness now and say that is all you need to succeed, the truth is that it demoralized me terribly. I would crawl into the house every night covered in dust after a long day in the coach house, exhausted and depressed because that day's cyclone had not worked.

#### 📚 Transcript

Unlike anyone I had met so far, they understood exactly what I was trying to do and knew exactly how to sell it. And within three weeks we had signed a deal by which I get front money of 35,000 plus design fees of 25,000 on completion of the drawings and then a 10% royalty with an annual minimum of 60,000. So this front money, which I've never done a license to, I didn't know anything about it. So one of the most important things, especially because usually the inventor is trying to license these things to larger companies, is when you're negotiating, you have to negotiate a large upfront payment because that's going to get you through the development because even if they buy your license and you sign a license agreement, it might take them years to start actually manufacturing and selling them thing, which means if you're only getting the royalty, by the time you get the royalty, you might have been out of business or in a wind bankrupt or whatever the case is. And then real quick, I want to point out on this deal where they saw the royalty was an annual minimum of 60,000. That's all he ever gets from these people because there's no way to prove how much they're selling.

We want to do it. They kind of rope a dope them. They wind up signing an agreement and he tells them all his ideas and gives them the information and he doesn't hear from them for a while. Then they sue him for fraud saying he lied to them, which he didn't. And that goes on. He's spending tons of money going deep into debt because Amway, you know, is a multi-billion dollar corporation at the time. And he's just some dude living in the outskirts of England. And they did all this just so later on. They made their own cyclone vacuum cleaner. So they took his technology, basically, and stole it. Later on in the book, he winds up getting retribution for this, but at the time it almost killed him. So that's what he means. I lost to Amway. And he goes in and he goes, I knew that if I had a product that was being sold successfully in Japan and which clearly worked, it would lift the Amway stigma and convince people that the cyclone had worked and not that we had duped anybody.

#### 📚 Transcript

You'll just see how insane. First, I'm jumping ahead. Let me focus on the design philosophy and then we'll get to the insane part. I have often over the years been asked what my design philosophy is or my philosophy of invention and have occasionally tried to put it on paper for those who do ask. It is a difficult thing to reduce to simple points because so much of it exists in my mind. A weird concoction of things I have seen and learnt but it might look something like this. I'm not going to cover all of them. I'm just going to cover ones that stuck out to me but heavy highlighting ahead. No one, number one. No one ever had an idea staring at a drawing board. So do not do this. I have always rather liked Francis Bacon's analogy of the spider in the bee. A spider he explained works entirely upon himself and from within himself and produces only poison whereas a bee works on raw materials deriving his product from nature at large and produces honey.
