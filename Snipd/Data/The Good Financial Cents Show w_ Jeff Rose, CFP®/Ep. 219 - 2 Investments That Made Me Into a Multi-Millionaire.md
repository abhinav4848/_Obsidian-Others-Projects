🎧 08:37 - 09:55 (01:18)

Trading options is a high-risk strategy, but you can start with small amounts of money to test it out. This way, when you have accumulated wealth to invest, you've already learned from your mistakes. Investing in the stock market has had a significant impact on my financial life. Another great investment has been in my online brand and personal brand. One of the best investments I made was becoming a Certified Financial Planner.

#### 📚 Transcript

I mean, even trading options, which is definitely the high risk strategy, but you can test that out with small amounts of money so that by the time you actually have accumulated some wealth where you actually now have thousands, if not tens of thousands of dollars to invest, now you've kind of just got all of that testing out of the way so that you don't go broke, try to leverage some high risk strategy and lose everything that you have. So there's no denying the impact that investing in stocks, investing in this stock market has had on my financial life. So that is the first investment. The second investment, when I started to really break it down, I mean, I could talk about investing into my business. I could talk about investing into my online business, but when I really started thinking about what has had the greatest impact on my net worth was had the largest impact on my financial status, it was investing into my brand, into my online brand, investing into my personal brand. Let's just start thinking about some of the best investments that I've made. And when I think back in time, one of them was becoming a CFP or Certified Financial Planner.
