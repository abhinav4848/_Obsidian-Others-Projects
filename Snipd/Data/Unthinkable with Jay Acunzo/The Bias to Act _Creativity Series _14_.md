###  [The Importance of Acting on Your Intuition](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2eb4171c-b8ac-4ab2-8e2d-89c4d298c7cc) 

🎧 17:32 - 18:44 (01:11)

Don't ignore your intuition. It's the key to creativity. Trust it and act on it. Wasting your intuition is worse than wasting time or energy. There's never a perfect time to act, but it's always the right time. So, go ahead and take your swing!

#### 📚 Transcript

Look, I get it. You probably have this internal guide, this feeling or even voice that's urging you to go make something. But then you somehow get locked in this never-ending conversation or outright battle with that guide. And the conversation always unfolds the same way. Did we think through this enough? Did we consider all our options? Did we find the best way, the best practice? What will others think? Maybe we should go get a friend's feedback first. It's just a quick email. It's just a tweet out to the world. But that internal voice or guide, that's your intuition. And without it, you can't create. But if you don't act on your intuition, it's totally useless. It's a wasted resource. So if you're so panicked about wasting your time, wasting your energy, or wasting a project that it prevents you from acting, just think there's nothing more terrible than wasting your intuition. It may never, ever be the perfect time to act, but it's always the right time. So, do your little golfers waggle before you take your swing

and above all else?
