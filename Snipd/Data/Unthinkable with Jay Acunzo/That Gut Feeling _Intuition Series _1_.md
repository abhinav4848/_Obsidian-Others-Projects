#### 📚 Transcript

Um, no. Okay, good. Because I'm not either. Now, what if I told you that with enough listening experience, not experience playing music, but enough experience just listening to music, you have the power to become a musical expert? Well,

I get on board with that. I mean, if I listened to enough music, I could be an expert, but you said genius and like, that's kind of like a thing you can't explain at all. And I could, I don't know, I don't know about that.

I did, I did. You got me there. Okay, here's the thing. So, I think that this isn't scientific research, might help us actually understand where that creative inspiration comes from. And it turns out your intuition isn't your gut. It just might be your subconscious brain feeding off of years and years of experience. So, so let's just start your, your musical expert training right now. How about

that? Okay. Um, I'm game, but how do we do that?
