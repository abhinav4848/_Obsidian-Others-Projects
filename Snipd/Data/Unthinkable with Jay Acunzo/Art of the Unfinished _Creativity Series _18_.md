###  [Embracing iterative approach in product management](https://share.snipd.com/snip/72fcd5bb-d0fd-4cbe-887a-94267e3fc1d3) 

🎧 14:15 - 15:40 (01:25)

Product managers, whether new to the role or with years of experience, should embrace the iterative approach to product development. Perfection is not the goal, but rather building something amazing and being pleased with the progress. It's important to avoid the feeling of paralysis by maintaining a list of tasks that need to be completed before launching.

#### 📚 Transcript

Adam is fairly new to product management, switching into the role just a few years ago. So it's tempting to believe that this is why he constantly gut checks his work before it's done. And I actually thought that too. But then I talked to Karen Rubin, a product leader at a company called Quantopian. Karen has been doing this job for more than a decade and even she doesn't believe in trying to make some kind of finished product before launching. Instead, she thinks about building

iteratively. Building iteratively doesn't mean that it's going to be perfect and nothing ever is perfect. Rarely are things done. But you can build something amazing that isn't perfect and still be pretty pleased with what you've

done. Ten years of building products for a living and she never feels like things are finished or ready. But here's where I'm personally struggling right now. If you lead a career like that, where you don't ever feel like something is done or perfect, how does that not just paralyze you? I mean, just thinking about this right now, I kind of feel like locking myself in a room, pulling my knees up to my chest and just rocking back and forth very slowly. For Karen though, she avoids that paralysis the old fashioned way. She keeps a list.

I always have a list of the things that's like, this is what has to get done before we can launch.

###  [Feeding Intuition with Inputs and Seeking External Perspective](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fe58419b-a4e3-4a96-bef3-c34ac953741c) 

🎧 17:57 - 19:28 (01:30)

Feeding intuition with more inputs helps to better inform it, rather than getting lost in solitary moments. Seeking external perspective is crucial to avoid getting too close to what we're building and to assess readiness for launch. The concept of 'done' is subjective, akin to fitness, and there's an art to creating unfinished art, as making art is a continuous process of launching things that could always be improved.

#### 📚 Transcript

It's not about ignoring your intuition, but rather feeding it more and more inputs to better inform it. Because in a vacuum, or really, I should say, a coffee shop or an office somewhere, wherever you and I create stuff, we might be wrong. In our moments alone, it's easy to get lost. When that jungle thickens and you lose sight of the mountain way in the distance, we start wandering in circles following our intuition, maybe without realizing it. Instead, what we really need to do is just pick a direction and move forward already. But that actually

goes right to my initial point of how I need somebody to help me see the forest for the trees occasionally because I get so deep in the weeds of building something that I often are CEO, Fos, or Dan Dunn that serves it for me where I have to go to be like, am I ready to launch? Like, to help me walk through this because we can all get too close to what we're building. As craft driven creators, we

want to make art that we feel is perfectly done. But when you really stop to think about it, what does done even mean? Let's go back to Adam Segal for a second.

No, Dunn is a term that we come up with, right? There's no actual definition of done. It's like fitness, right? Everyone has their own definition

of it. There's a certain art behind making things that are unfinished because as it turns out, that's all making art ever actually is. Launching thing after thing that could always be just a little
