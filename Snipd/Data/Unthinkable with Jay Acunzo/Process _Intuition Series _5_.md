#### 📚 Transcript

They actually had a phrase in my office where I would submit a piece and then they would strip the Justin out of it and basically just remove the personality and write for conversion and for character count. But what we're starting to find is sometimes it's good to have a little bit of Justin in there and we've kind of proved it. We've done some A.B. testing. I think the fact is if it's fun to write it's fun to read and ultimately that's going to make somebody click. Fun is a word that doesn't often survive that jungle where words like process or documentation often prowl. But if those things can help the fire burn quicker, better or brighter then fun is the spark.
