3. Eddy is not suitable for families with young children
4. Eddy prefers to sleep in a crate rather than on a bed

#### 📚 Transcript

I forget where it came from,

that we just decided we would market him as the absolute worst dog in the world.

Three reasons you don't want to adopt eddy the terrible. Like to go for walks in dog infested areas. Enjoy the dog park. Keep walking. He's never actually attacked another dog, but he's made it abundantly clear that he hasn't ruled out the possibility he goes zero to cojo in point five seconds. Want your kids to grow up with a full complement of fingers and toes? Not the dog for you. Some dogs love kids. We have a bunch of child loving dogs here. Eddie the terrible, however, is not one of them. Looking for a simple dog that will sleep in his crate. Not your guy. A bed in your room. Awesome, in bed with you. Better in a crate. Let him sing you the song of his people.

###  [Using Personal Anecdotes to Make Your Work Memorable](https://share.snipd.com/snip/399a5e4a-f2fb-4b3e-ac09-2e59e91ab9f9) [[Processed]]

🎧 19:18 - 20:15 (00:56)

To make your work more memorable and authentic, incorporate a personal anecdote into the very next thing you create. This can be in any form of work, such as writing, pitching an idea, networking, or even brewing cider. By including a personal anecdote, you will begin to infuse more of your personal experiences, opinions, and beliefs into your work, making it uniquely yours. This will enhance the authenticity of your work and make it more memorable to others.

#### 📚 Transcript

so here's our challenge this week. In order to better follow your intuition and put more of you ito your work, the very next thing you create this week, use a personal anecdote somewhere in it. That's it. That's the challenge. This could be literally anything, not just writing of some kind. Maybe you're putting together a deck to pitch an idea, or you have a meeting to network with somebody, or you're bottling your next home brewed cider. Whatever you're creating in the next seven daysfind a place for a personal anecdote that supports what you're trying to say to the world and involve it for others to see, hear or find. Once you do that, i promise you, it'll start to snowball. You'll start to weave more personal experiences into your work, then personal opinions and beliefs, and before long, all this other more subtle stuff that makes your work wholly you and makes it memorable.
