###  [The Happiest Guy in the World: A Life on Cruise Ships](https://share.snipd.com/snip/97c5ef94-0b29-4414-a080-e836703b730b) 

🎧 33:37 - 35:31 (01:54)

A man who lives on cruise ships considers himself the happiest guy in the world, but a short film questions this claim. While he has freedom and control over his time, there is a sense of loneliness and disconnect. The staff on the cruise ship play along as his friends, but it's not a genuine friendship. This highlights the mistake of valuing time as something to hoard rather than share. The film explores the life of a digital nomad who runs their business while traveling the world.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Oliver Burkeman:** Yes. There's this guy who is the subject of a New York Times short movie called The Happiest Guy in the World, I think it's called, which is how he describes himself. And he's a fellow who has constructed a life spent almost entirely living on board cruise ships as a sort of the ultimate loyal customer of the cruise line that he frequents. It's just a short, really well-made movie. And you can tell from the title that the filmmaker also is sceptical of his self-description as the happiest guy in the world. He has sort of total control, in a sense, over what he does with his time. He is not bound to a location. He's not bound to a job. He's not bound to chores because that's all handled for him. And there's just a sort of deep poignancy that comes across in this short movie again not sure he'd agree this is my interpretation about what i would feel of what i would say is loneliness right it's this sense that he is out of sync he's not synchronized with the rhythms of anybody else's lives and as a result there are these sort of awkward moments in the film where he's greeting the staff of the cruise ship, referring to them as his friends, and you have a kind of a sense coming off them that like, yeah, they're going along with being his friends because they're the employees of the cruise line, right? They're not going to be rude to him, but it's not a friendship. And I think that a lot of this has to do with the idea that what I would say, if I was in that position, I would say that I had made a major mistake in thinking that time is best understood as this thing that you should sort of hoard as much of as you can for yourself, achieve a kind of total sovereignty over it if you can, as opposed to something that gets its value as a kind of a network good, right? Gets its value from being shared. There's all sorts of anecdotes from people who sort of become digital nomads, you know, and roam the world running their businesses from their laptops. Lots of plus points to that.

###  [Regular Goods vs Network Goods: Understanding the Difference](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c5dc37b9-d1e4-4ea5-9336-4ad41f18afa7) 

🎧 36:02 - 36:56 (00:53)

The difference between regular goods and network goods is highlighted. While having more money is generally preferred, the value of network goods, like cell phones, lies in their widespread adoption. Time should be viewed as a network good, as it is valuable when shared. The speaker suggests discussing the fascinating Soviet experiment on the asynchronicity of time.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Peter Attia:** about regular goods versus network goods is important. Let's even continue to expand on that, right? So classic regular good is money. All things equal, more of it is better than less of it. So in other words, there's some, even though you could argue you could hoard all the money in world, it's not going to make you happy. But if you could choose between having more or less, it's logical why you would choose more. But I think, you know, the great example of cell phones, telephones.

**Oliver Burkeman:** Right. You don't want to have all the cell phones. You just need one and you want

**Peter Attia:** everyone else to have one of them. So that's what makes the network work. Such a great point. That's a network good. And to think of time as money is missing the point a little bit. You need to think of time as cell phones. It's have to time that everyone else has. And to your point, maybe this would be a great time to kind of talk about the great Soviet experiment, about the asynchronicity of time. I thought that was so fascinating. I never really considered that before.

###  [The Challenge of Prioritizing Big Rocks](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6cbc52a8-5df3-41c9-bb9a-66a884981ecf) 

🎧 42:46 - 44:07 (01:21)

In the modern world, humans face the challenge of having too many big rocks, or important matters, to deal with. While there are benefits to organizing our days and prioritizing, the real courage lies in neglecting many big rocks to focus on a few. Saying no is not just about rejecting unwanted tasks, but also about refusing things we do want to do in order to make time for what truly matters. Despite our assumption that the number of things that matter should align with our limited time, the reality is that there will always be more things that matter than we can handle.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Oliver Burkeman:** jar. And I argue in the book that a problem that we have as humans, but especially as humans in the modern world, the real problem that we have is that there are just far too many big rocks. There are far too many things that legitimately matter or could be said to matter. So there are certainly marginal benefits to around the edges, you know, to kind of how you're arranging your day and making sure that you're putting in the important stuff and not spending too much time on stuff that doesn't matter. But the really big challenge, I think, is seeing that there will always be more big rocks than we'll have time for and having the courage, really, to neglect a whole lot of them in order to focus on a few of them. Being willing, Elizabeth Gilbert says this, right? She has a great line about how we think that saying no is so important because if we say no to all the stuff we don't want to do, we'll have time for the things that we do want to do. But actually, the true art of saying no is saying no to things you do want to do in order to do some other things that you do want to do. Because deep, deep, deep in our minds, there seems to be this assumption of some sort of natural law that says, well, like we're only going to feel that the number of things we're going to feel like they matter has ultimately got to match up to the time that we have. It just isn't the case. We can feel that vastly more matters than we're going to have time for.

###  [A Moment of Clarity on Productivity and Work](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e86390a5-605c-4924-a367-aacccc30fdec) 

🎧 47:17 - 48:01 (00:43)

In 2014, the author had a moment of clarity while sitting on a bench in Prospect Park, Brooklyn. This realization was related to productivity and work, and it took years for the author to fully live into it. Although their life didn't change immediately, they felt the weight of their responsibilities on a winter morning and realized the overwhelming number of tasks they had to accomplish by the end of the week.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Peter Attia:** is it that you sort of realized circa 2014? You write about this sort of moment of clarity. I think you were sitting on a bench somewhere in Brooklyn. Oh yeah. Prospect Park. Yeah. How did this sort of coalesce

**Oliver Burkeman:** for you then? This was very much on the sort of productivity and work side of this whole thing. And it was a kind of an intellectual epiphany. I don't know, you might resonate with this, right? You can sometimes figure things out in an intellectual level and then it takes kind of years to live into them in a real way. So it wasn't like my life changed that moment, but it was a winter morning. In the middle of the week, I had like a huge, even more larger number of things I felt like I had to do by the end of that week than normal.

###  [The struggle of reconciling with time and finitude](https://share.snipd.com/snip/65d0e14a-fc3a-4f44-9a9f-370d224b7e4c) 

🎧 01:02:19 - 01:03:34 (01:15)

The struggle to find enough time and master the future creates anxiety. Recognizing the truth of trade-offs and limited time leads to a different feeling - a poignant sadness. Living a meaningful life means consciously accepting the fact that time is limited. A unifying theory, like in physics, doesn't provide a solution to this. The speaker's engineering background wants an equation, but it doesn't apply here.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Oliver Burkeman:** And so this comes back before, actually, I wanted to say in response to talking about the person you were talking about who died and the fact that one doesn't stop feeling sad about those things or struggling with those things. The person who thinks going to find a way to master their time and make enough time for everything is trapped in this kind of future-oriented anxiety. The person who sort of sees the truth about trade-offs and the truth about finitude doesn't suddenly become happy and reconciled to it all, but it's a different kind of feeling. It's a kind of poignancy, right? There's a sort of sad tinge to life that you don't get away from. But, you know, sort of struggling to articulate this, but it's part of living a meaningful life is to just sort of be consciously in that fact that we don't get all the time we would wish to have. I don't know if that made sense.

**Peter Attia:** I have yet to construct this unifying theory because a unifying theory in some ways suggests a solution. It's a series of equations. Unifying theories in physics are equations. I don't think there's an equation here, even though my engineering background wants one.

###  [Accepting the Lack of Solutions in the Human Condition](https://share.snipd.com/snip/061ccc21-7e47-4385-b11b-1d4e85d28f95) 

🎧 01:04:20 - 01:05:33 (01:13)

Accepting that there is no ultimate solution to the human condition is a liberating psychological shift. Instead, focus on maximizing the quality of your experiences and the time available to have more of them. Zen Buddhism teaches us that our obsession with finding a cure for our existence drives us mad. As Jocko Beck, an American Zen teacher, wisely said, the unbearable part is our mistaken belief that there is a cure. A friend once stated that from a certain perspective, everything is palliative care because we all have a finite lifespan. This realization does not lead to nihilism, but rather a new perspective on embracing life.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Oliver Burkeman:** It's the acceptance of the fact that there isn't a solution that is such a powerful psychological transition, I think. And totally goes along with doing everything you possibly can to sort of maximize both the quality of your experience and the amount of time you can have the probability of having more time to have those experiences. But it steps away from this idea that one day you're going to find the solution to the human condition. There are all these great sayings and phrases and ways of putting it that come out of Zen Buddhism, where people are sort of pointing to this notion that what drives us crazy is thinking that there has to be a solution to the condition in which we find ourselves. So the quote I use at the beginning of the book from Jocko Beck, the American Zen teacher, is she said, what makes it unbearable is your mistaken belief that it can be cured, which is quite an interestingly sort of medical way of stating the problem. A friend of mine years ago, who's a meditation person as well, said, from a certain point of view, everything is palliative care because, you know, none of us is getting out of this alive. There are plenty of sort of more cliched sayings that pinpoint this same problem. I don't think that's a recipe for nihilism. I that's

###  [The Two Types of Saying No: Identifying What You Do and Don't Want to Do](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5efb131c-5b32-42ad-a9d0-328d426a80c3) 

🎧 01:26:23 - 01:27:08 (00:44)

There are two types of saying no: saying no to things you don't want to do, and saying no to things you want to do but are not top priorities. Three years ago, I started keeping a journal of all the things I said no to, particularly the ones I wanted to do but weren't top priorities.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Peter Attia:** strong. You made a point before, but I want to reiterate it because I think it's so important, which is there's two types of saying no. There's saying no to things you don't actually want to do that maybe on the surface might look like they're worth doing, but deep down you don't want to do them, so you're kind of happy to say no. But then they're saying no to things that you do want to do, but you know are not top five. And, you know, about three years ago, I really started to take that seriously. So seriously, in fact, that that became the source of, or the substrate for my journaling was I kept a no journal. All the things I said no to with an emphasis on things that I actually wanted to do were all FOMO machines, but

###  [Idleness Aversion and the Need for Patience](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0724624a-85e2-42af-8087-c2aca7500bbb) 

🎧 01:28:01 - 01:29:27 (01:26)

Jennifer Roberts, a professor at Harvard, has her art history students participate in a three-hour exercise where they choose a painting or sculpture in the area and look at it without distractions. This exercise aims to counteract the fast-paced culture and pressures of university life, encouraging students to slow down and appreciate art.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Peter Attia:** didn't talk much about it, but I think you part and parcel with this because we've touched on it is this idleness aversion. And the flip side of that is the need to be patient and how impatient we are. Tell the story of, I forget the name of the professor at Harvard, but she has a class, an art class, and the students going through it have to do this painful experience, which you yourself undertook. Yeah,

**Oliver Burkeman:** Jennifer Roberts. She has her incoming art history students at Harvard choose a painting or a sculpture in the area. There are many, many venues to do that in the Harvard area. And then go and look at it for three hours straight. And I did this, yeah, with a painting by Degas in the Harvard Art Museums. And the idea here, the motivation for her came from seeing the students who were coming into her course and feeling that their whole lives were so geared to speed. both just generally because of the way the technological culture works, but also because of the pressures of highly competitive university, right? There's all these kind of incentives to get stuff done as fast as you can, that it was actually her job, she felt, to kind of try to influence the tempo of what they were doing to slow them down. And she did it herself and I did it. And the really fascinating thing that you learn in this context, in the art case, I'll explain
