1. Exercise has a greater impact on reducing risk of Alzheimer's disease than any other intervention
2. Sleep and nutrition also matter in reducing risk of Alzheimer's disease
3. Exercise has many mechanisms by which it reduces risk of Alzheimer's disease

#### 📚 Transcript

**Peter Attia:** that the evidence is overwhelming that a person who exercises, especially at the right amount, we're talking not just 30 minutes a week type thing, but if you're really doing the work, having a greater impact on the reduction of risk of Alzheimer's disease than any other intervention you can take. Now, there are lots of interventions that matter. Sleep matters, nutrition, as we talked about, type 2 diabetes, all these things matter, but the risk reduction that comes from exercise is enormous. What do you think are the mechanisms by which that is happening? Because I suspect there's many.

**Rhonda Patrick:** Oh, definitely many mechanisms happening. And I would, first of all, I agree with you. Like, there's nothing better than exercise. Of course, any exercise is better than none. But for me, because as I mentioned at the start of this podcast, I'm very focused on neurodegenerative disease. I specifically sort of designed my workout routine based off of what I think are going to give me the biggest brain benefits. And what I've sort of come to the conclusion of is that intensity does make a difference with respect to the neurobiological effects. Exercise intensity. There are some mechanistic reasons for that, but just talking about what's moderate intensity exercise, what's considered vigorous intensity exercise, right? If you look at some of the recommendations out there by the committees, you know, there's a team of scientists, physicians that sort of analyze all this data and then make these health recommendations based off of that data. It's 150 to 300 minutes of moderate intensity exercise, which I think they define as like 50 to 70% of maximum heart rate. Vigorous intensity, they say 75 minutes, I guess, a week. And that would be more of you're getting above the like 75 to 85% max heart rate. So that's what they, I think, define as something like that, vigorous. And they have a variety of examples. You know, there's the World Health Organization. There's a variety of committees that come to that same conclusion. For me, I like to go higher intensity. This is something I kind of was looking forward to talking to you about because it has to do with how do you measure the estimated heart rate, which is what I do. I've estimated. And again, all sorts of problems with that based on your physical fitness.
