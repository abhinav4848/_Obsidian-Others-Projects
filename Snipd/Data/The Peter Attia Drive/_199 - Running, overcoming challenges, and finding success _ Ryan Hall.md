###  [Early Physical Activity Shapes Cardiovascular System](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cc89d28f-94b7-40b2-9400-0bbaa83f76f8) 

🎧 07:09 - 07:55 (00:45)

Being physically active during the formative years of one's cardiovascular system is crucial as it leads to malleability in the system. Encouraging teenagers to engage in intense physical activities helps in developing a strong cardiovascular system that can be beneficial in the future.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ryan Hall:** And I suspect

**Peter Attia:** there's something to being in that environment when you're young during the formative years of your cardiovascular system. I look at like my daughter who's 13 and she loves volleyball and basketball, but doesn't like cross country or track. And I, I, I'm trying not to be a psycho about it, but I'm also sort of telling her like, you have this really narrow window in which your cardiovascular system is quite malleable. And I'm very fortunate that because I was involved in boxing, I had to do so much cardio, both aerobic and anaerobic training during those formative years. And even though I'm a fraction of that level of fitness today, I can still ride on what I had then. But I feel like if you don't push that system hard in your teenage years, it's very hard to develop it later.

###  [Training for a Marathon, Not a Sprint](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1bf476ae-f526-4ab1-8d4f-6b959f2c4791) 

🎧 22:55 - 23:51 (00:56)

The speaker recalls a story about a treadmill set at a pace of four forty two, inspired by a sponsor's idea. The story involved random people trying to hold the pace the speaker maintains for a little over two hours. People struggled to keep up, with most getting shot off the treadmill after 30-40 seconds, only one person lasting a minute. The speaker had a sign in their office with the pace time to remind themselves that training for a marathon requires a consistent effort, not a sprint.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Peter Attia:** which is funny because I can't either. I know, but it's just, it's so fast. And I used to have a sign in my office that said 442. So it was a pace clock and it said 442. And it actually came from, I remember getting this idea off something one of your sponsors did for one of your races. Many, many years ago, they had a treadmill set up to that pace. And the idea was they just had random people show up and they're like, how long can you hold the pace that he holds for a little over two hours? And so they put a harness around a person's waist and they'd make them run at 442. And these people were getting shot off the back of this treadmill 30 seconds, 40 seconds. One made it a minute, right? And the reason I had that sign up in my office was I was very circumspect slash put off by the notion that people would say, hey man, we're training for a marathon, not a sprint. This
