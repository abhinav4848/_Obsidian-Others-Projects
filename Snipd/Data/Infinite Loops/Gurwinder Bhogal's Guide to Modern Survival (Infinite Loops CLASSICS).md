## Snips

###  [External Locus of Control](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0989ff10-b078-4a82-b30c-db949399c056) 

🎧 19:32 - 21:10 (01:38)

- Believing you lack control perpetuates the problem and prevents you from addressing environmental factors. 
- This externalization is exacerbated by cultural narratives that diminish individual agency and overemphasize systemic issues.

#### 💬 Quote

> If you believe you don't have control in your life, then you don't.
> — Gurwinder Bhogal

Gurwinder Bhogal on how people can rectify environmental problems.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Gurwinder Bhogal:** If you believe you don't have control in your life, then you don't. And it prevents people from actually rectifying any sort of environmental problems that may be sort of, you know, preventing them from achieving what they want to. And so I think that this issue, I think, is probably a much greater issue in the 20th century, particularly when it comes to the ways in which culture changed, the ways and the kinds of problems we're having now with regards to this sort of this woke mind virus. I think a big part of it is due to this externalization of the locus of control. But I think what's very interesting is to ask ourselves why this has happened. Why has there been an externalization of a locus of control? i think well height in his essay he posits that it's due to the kinds of culture that we have allowed to essentially proliferate within our school systems within our university systems which sort of teach a distorted view of history and which teach distorted science, particularly distorted social sciences, which sort of essentially diminish, they sort of, they tend to like, for instance, the social sciences that we have now, they tend to downplay the effects of individual agency. And they sort of tend to overemphasize systemic issues. So that could be, again, systemic racism. It could be the patriarchy, capitalism, colonialism, many of these isms, which apparently are these overarching systems which are preventing people from accomplishing their goals. prevalent in the social sciences.

###  [Cognitive Laziness](https://share.snipd.com/snip/72ba8f3d-6fef-4510-9309-116b04869e31) 

🎧 27:17 - 28:00 (00:43)

- People are cognitively lazy and prefer simple labels that rearrange their prejudices.
- Victimization and constant amusement are tools to control people by denying their agency.

#### 💬 Quote

> I would do my very best to baffle people with bullshit. I would throw tons of conspiracy theories out there. I would get them to believe that they were victims, that they had no agency.
> — Jim O’Shaughnessy

Jim O’Shaughnessy describing his plan to control people if he had unlimited resources.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Jim O'Shaughnessy:** And so the idea of victimization. So if I were evil and I had unlimited resources, what I would do is not too dissimilar to what's been happening over the last 10 years, particularly in the West. I would do my very best to baffle people with bullshit. I would throw tons of conspiracy theories out there. I would get them to believe that they were victims, that they had no agency. Brave New World is probably a better predictive book than 1984, right? It's like, what do you mean we're going to burn Fahrenheit

###  [Individual Action](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fefcf1c1-913d-4ee3-b6d1-db88237bce7b) 

🎧 38:16 - 38:57 (00:40)

- Individual action, especially when backed by tangible commitment, is crucial for driving change. 
- Having 'skin in the game' forces people to prioritize truth over trends.

#### 💬 Quote

> It really comes down to individual actions by people who are willing to sort of put their money where their mouth is or essentially have some skin in the game.
> — Gurwinder Bhogal

Gurwinder Bhogal on how to improve society

#### 📚 Transcript

**Gurwinder Bhogal:** And although I think that he's not done a great job with Twitter, I think not as good as he's done with SpaceX or with Tesla, he's definitely changed the conversation, I think, because by buying Twitter and essentially opening up the Overton window, he's allowed conversations to be happening now on Twitter. That couldn't happen three years ago. So I think it really comes down to individual actions by people who are willing to sort of put their money where their mouth is or essentially have some skin in the game. I think skin in the game is probably the most important thing. I think when people really have skin in the game, that's when people have to

###  [Surrendering Agency](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ad0f53c3-b10e-4e22-8ebc-4539cd6f7910) 

🎧 01:21:13 - 01:23:13 (01:59)

- If you surrender your agency, you are essentially a natural slave, according to the ancient Greeks. 
- People who understand this idea would likely take steps to correct it.

#### 💬 Quote

> If you surrender your agency, if you surrender your internal locus of control, you are essentially what the ancient Greeks would have called a natural slave, right? A slave mentality.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Jim O'Shaughnessy:** I love it. But one of the things that he brings up endlessly is this idea that if you surrender your agency, if you surrender your internal locus of control, you are essentially what the ancient Greeks would have called a natural slave, right? A slave mentality. are letting yourself have a slave mentality, which if I think if your average human knew that, they wouldn't like the I am what? No, I'm you know, I'm not that. And they would at least sort of take steps to try to correct that and then the idea of like metagames right change the rules I don't know if you're a Star Trek fan but the Kubiashi Maru yeah right the Kubiashi Maru yeah and how did Kirk be how was he the only one to beat it he reprogrammed the simulation. I love that because that's the way I like to approach life. It's like, no, I'm not going to play by those rules. I'm going to make up new rules and play by those. And that's what's kind of guiding our entire series that we're kind of doing in a halting fashion, but that we call the great reshuffle. Right. It's like all of these old rule books are collapsing. And you've got a lot of people going, what the fuck? What? This worked all of this time and it no longer works. Well, because we're going into this new world, right? And if you understand that, and one of the things I admire about you with your razors and the maxims is those are excellent. They're compressed knowledge, right? Why do we have maxims? compressed, compressed, compressed until you get down to, you know,

###  [Stop Passive Consumption](https://share.snipd.com/snip/36956827-1649-478a-b0a3-8aeac2db3b30) 

🎧 01:33:00 - 01:34:18 (01:17)

Jim O’Shaughnessy on how to avoid the constant stream of negative news.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Jim O'Shaughnessy:** It's just different parking points, really. And so one thing I say to people, do yourself a favor, stop passively consuming information like through a TV. I stopped watching TV news almost 15 years ago. And honestly, I cannot tell you when I see clips, they horrify me. It's like, I can't believe that people sit and watch this. And again, back to different generations, my dear mother-in is nearly 98 years old and she sit and listens to news i'm doing air quotes here for people just listening news all day long and she's filled with despair because like it's just the doom doom doom you can counter program these days and like that's one of the things. I sort of believe if you can make a difference, you've got to try to make a difference. I don't try to engage myself in non-computable problems. Roger Penrose calls a lot of things that people spend endless times arguing about non-computable, right? Robert Persig would say the answer is mu, M-U, which is like, there is no answer to that particular
