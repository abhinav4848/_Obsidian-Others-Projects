- Episode AI description: In this lively chat, Alex Danco, a communications expert and writer now with a16z, delves into the intricate dance between VCs and founders, whom he dubs the 'kings and priests' of tech. He emphasizes the need for founders to own their narratives and revives the lost art of speechwriting, referencing Reagan's rhetorical finesse. The discussion spans America's 'hypomanic DNA' and its surprising cultural parallels with China, culminating in a call for authenticity in communication and a warning against neglecting thoughtful reading.

- Alex Danco recalls that when he was doing his startup, nobody listened to him unless he could talk about something he had read from Paul Graham, Semil Shah, Mark Suster, or Fred Wilson.
- After mastering and casting that 'spell', people would listen to him for about 45 minutes.

#### 💬 Quote

> The default state of the world is that nobody listens to you at all, right? Everybody just completely ignores you and no one takes you seriously, except [...] when I would read whatever that day's Paul Graham post or Semel Shah or like Mark Schuster or Fred Wilson [...] where you would read it and you would really do the work of understanding [...] And it would really work, right? You would cast that spell and then for 45 minutes, people would listen to you.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Alex Danco:** It's like, you know, the money is helpful, but you don't, it's not a prerequisite. And I remember in the, in the old days, you know, something that had a really big effect on me was when I was doing my startup, I remember very well that like the default state of the world is that nobody listens to you at all, right? Everybody just completely ignores you and no one takes you seriously, except there would be one exception to this, which is that when I would read whatever that day's Paul Graham post or Semel Shah or like Mark Schuster or Fred Wilson or all the people who are blogging in those days, where you would read it and you would really do the work of understanding and

Alex Danco on the impact of great speeches

#### 📚 Transcript

**Alex Danco:** Because if you can tip perceptions just a little bit towards people kind of mimetically being like, oh, like, they had a great speech at their launch announcement, I need to have a great speech for my launch announcement, or whatever. If you can just get people to like kind of flip their orientation towards like that sort of competition, then it's like you could increase the overall level of seriousness and the overall degree to which the good work that these founders are doing actually being heard by the outside world. Right. In a very high leverage way. Right. A relatively small amount of initial effort, you know, talking a few people andto-day jobs, could result in a massive change in the overall impact of what is actually heard by the outside world about why these founders are doing the work they do. So, end of soliloquy.

**Jim O'Shaughnessy:** because as you were outlining your goal for me, I was immediately seeing Winston Churchill. was immediately seeing Kennedy saying America will land a man on the moon when we had absolutely no technologies in place that allowed for that.

**Alex Danco:** those are amazing speeches they're so good as someone who was

**Jim O'Shaughnessy:** a young man when that was happening and was watching him how could not feel like a million bucks? You absolutely did. And where he won. And like, got the tinglys despite, I, you know, I wasn't a huge Reagan fan, but, but despite it, every time that guy would get up there,
