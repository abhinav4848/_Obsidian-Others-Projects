1. 83% of people answer at least one problem incorrectly in the cognitive reflection test conducted under laboratory conditions
2. Group discussions can lead individuals to change their minds from wrong answers to right answers
3. One cognitive system is used for producing reasons and another for evaluating other people's reasons
4. Group discussions allow for the picking apart of poor reasoning and the synthesis of good reasoning
5. Repeated group deliberations can lead to the development and evolution of an agreed upon worldview

#### 📚 Transcript

When it comes to the cognitive reflection test, reasoning alone, 83% of people who have taken this test under laboratory conditions answer at least one of the problems incorrectly, and a third get all of them wrong. But in groups of three or more, usually the entire group will change their minds from the wrong answer to the right answer. That's because at least one member will see the correct answer, and the resulting debate will lead those who are wrong, which is usually most people, to change their minds. So what seems to be happening here, and there's great research behind it, is that we use one cognitive system for producing reasons and arguments and propositions, and we use another cognitive system for the evaluation of other people's reasons and arguments and propositions. That's because we evolved to produce biased and lazy arguments from our unique perspectives, and then offload the cognitive labor of evaluating those arguments to group discussions, where everyone's arguments can be picked apart for poor reasoning and reassembled with everyone's bits of good reasoning once articulated, once presented, combined, all into a cohesive plan of action, and over time, it can become an agreed upon worldview that itself can evolve each time we meet up to deliberate and trade arguments.
