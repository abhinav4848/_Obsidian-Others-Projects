###  [From Top Student to Existential Crisis: Reflecting on Conventional Success](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3f03e631-52ec-4c02-96a2-1c5e4c5bee6e) 

🎧 05:46 - 07:03 (01:17)

From being a struggling student, I transformed into a top achiever. However, I never took the time to discover my true passions or express myself. I was solely focused on excelling in the prescribed path of school, career, and success. It wasn't until I faced a crisis that I finally had the chance to reflect on my choices and open up to new possibilities.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Rich Roll:** and I became a better student. I had always struggled in school, but by the time I graduated from high school, I was top of my class and got very good at playing the game of getting into all the colleges and going to the right place and getting the right job without ever any self-reflection on what it was that I wanted to do or what excited me or what was unique about me or how I wanted to show up in the world or express myself, I was just trying to excel. like go to this school, get this job, show up early, work late, sort of climb that corporate ladder, went to law school, was on the partnership track at a law firm, did all of that and had to basically suffer an existential and health crisis as a reckoning in order to look inward on myself and reflect upon the reasons why I made those decisions, why they were leading me astray, and begin the process of opening the aperture of my vision to allow space for something new and different.

###  [Common Misconceptions About Reinvention](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5cd3de1c-36e4-43f4-b282-bd09b0119e4b) 

🎧 07:03 - 08:11 (01:07)

People often underestimate the effort and time it takes to reinvent their life. They expect instant results and become impatient when they don't see them. However, true reinvention requires hard work, resilience, and a willingness to embrace failure and uncertainty. Instead of retreating to what's safe, successful reinventors persevere and take risks to create the life they desire.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Chris Williamson:** do you think people get wrong about reinvention? Like, what is it that the people who fail to turn their life around do?

**Rich Roll:** I think people think it's a magic trick. They snap their fingers, they make a decision, and their life is different overnight. I think there's a lack of appreciation of everything that goes into the moment where you change your mind and you do something different, and then all of the work that goes into that rebuilding phase and the aftermath of making that decision that ultimately creates the new life. I think people are impatient. They want results too quickly. They don't appreciate the amount of hard work that goes into actually crafting the life of your desires. And I think as a result of that, when they don't see results immediately, they burn out and retreat to what's safe and what they know versus welcoming failure, welcoming uncertainty, getting comfortable

###  [The Hard Work of Changing Your Life](https://share.snipd.com/snip/06c2510f-3cfa-44dc-a319-4899ac6fbcf8) 

🎧 07:22 - 08:48 (01:25)

People often underestimate the hard work and time required to change their lives. Impatience and a lack of appreciation for the rebuilding process can lead to burnout and sticking to what's safe. It's important to embrace failure, uncertainty, and risk while persisting in creating a life true to oneself. The montage of training in movies is misleading; in reality, it can take years. Understanding the challenges can help individuals going through tough times feel less burdened.

I think there's a lack of appreciation of everything that goes into the moment where you change your mind and you do something different, and then all of the work that goes into that rebuilding phase and the aftermath of making that decision that ultimately creates the new life. I think people are impatient. They want results too quickly. They don't appreciate the amount of hard work that goes into actually crafting the life of your desires. And I think as a result of that, when they don't see results immediately, they burn out and retreat to what's safe and what they know versus welcoming failure, welcoming uncertainty, getting comfortable with risk, and remaining persistent in their vision to create something more in alignment with their

**Chris Williamson:** authentic self. think one of the big problems, especially when it comes to reinvention is in the Rocky movies, the montage of training is two and a half minutes long. In reality, it can be a decade. And I think getting really visceral with what tough times feel like helps people who are going through them to not feel so personally cursed while they're going through them. You

###  [The Power of Faith and Perseverance in Overcoming Challenges](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bc1a741c-8a95-4b8e-aa23-534b742079ef) 

🎧 11:49 - 13:50 (02:01)

In moments of fear and doubt, faith and self-belief are crucial. You must hold onto your vision for a better life and trust in a higher power. The universe will support you if you align your actions with your values and do the necessary inner work. The results may not come on your timeline or in the expected way, but karma will eventually bring you what you deserve. Continuously stacking the deck against yourself only leaves winning up to chance.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Rich Roll:** I think I'm wired for it as a result of my background, the way I was raised, my experiences in swimming. I feel like I'm well-equipped to kind of handle that, but I've been brought to my knees more than once. And I can tell you in those moments, all you feel is fear and this overpowering impulse to retreat back to what you know. And it is in those moments, those are the moments of truth that no one sees, where you're at your breaking point. And that's where faith comes in, honestly. You have to believe in yourself. You have to be able to hold that vision for the better life of your aspirations. And you have to also have an almost transcendent self. transcendent sense of some other force at play that has your best interest at heart, such that if your heart is true and you are truly engaged in the process of trying to align your actions with your values and you have excavated your soul and done the interior work to try to really get honest with yourself and you're earnest in that regard, I do believe that the universe will at some point conspire to support you. It's not going to be on your timeline. It's not going to be convenient. The results aren't going to look like you think they're going to look. But I've seen this play out in my life many times and in the lives of many people that I'm close with. Yeah,

**Chris Williamson:** there's a cool quote from Naval that says, karma doesn't need quantum energy or spiritual woo to be real. Karma is just you repeating your patterns, virtues, and flaws until you finally get what you deserve. And I think that it doesn't matter how secular you want to get with it, that if you continue to stack the deck against yourself, the only way that you end up winning is purely by fluke. And that chance of fluke begins to get increasingly minuscule.

###  [Examining the Influence of Surroundings on Personal Development](https://share.snipd.com/snip/afcbe64e-0fe7-4daa-8681-069a94c02b4b) 

🎧 25:03 - 26:09 (01:05)

Being in control of our own community is important. Surrounding ourselves with positive influences and mentors can make a big difference in our lives. Let's strive to be the pilot of our own direction.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Rich Roll:** a bad influence. It's just at best neutral or perhaps somebody who's insidiously but very gradually undermining the quality of that companion's life. Like you, I also get a lot of those types of messages and it's very meaningful to me. And I think what you're speaking about is super important. Of course, there's that adage, you're the average of the five people you're listening to. Oh, sorry. The average of the five podcasts you listen to. Probably, right? Excuse me. But I think it is worthy of examination, this because most people just end up in the environment that they're in and they never try to be in the in the pilot chair of how they're directing their community there's a lot of talk about mentors. I want this person to be my mentor.

###  [Surrounding Yourself with Extraordinary but Normal Role Models](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a27eb75c-3ba6-4723-b4ac-a8333e5f7e12) 

🎧 30:11 - 31:55 (01:44)

"Most of my friends are my role models," tweeted the speaker, expressing gratitude for the extraordinary yet relatable actions of the people in their life. They highlighted instances of courageous decision-making and even a personal achievement, emphasizing that these friends are both exceptional and ordinary. The speaker understands that listeners may feel envious of their social circle, but emphasizes that one's friends ultimately shape their behavior. If someone has the time to engage with lengthy podcasts, they likely have the capacity to seize control of their own life."

#### 📚 Transcript

**Chris Williamson:** I tweeted this a little while ago saying, I'm in the very fortunate position where most of my friends are also my role models. And that's not that my role models are my friends, right? It's the other way around. It's that the people that I'm friends with in the UK, in America, people that are beyond mundanely normal do things that on a dinnerly basis, I look at and I go, that's extraordinary. Like the way that they dealt with a difficult conversation that they had to have, the way that they made an awkward decision with regards to their business where somebody wasn't fitting and they said it in the right way early with courage and bravery, right up to my housemate had a clip from his YouTube channel Sh on Rogan, a couple of days ago. So he's fired up for that. I'm like, each of these different people, extraordinary in some ways and unbelievably normal in many more ways. And I understand if you're listening to this and it's triggering a little bit of something inside of you going, well, it must be nice living in Austin, Texas Calabasas or whatever, and you're surrounded by all these people, and you know, you've got interest in blue ticks knocking on your door, asking to be friends. I do get that, but the bottom line is that you will devolve to the lowest common denominator amongst the friend group that you're in, and if you have the luxury of being able to sit and listen to pontificating podcasts for like two hours, you are probably built to take charge of that situation. And

###  [Authenticity and Living Your Values in Relationships](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cd9c0052-8a5f-402a-b738-a36f451159ce) 

🎧 33:51 - 35:39 (01:47)

To attract the people you want in your life, be genuine, live by your values, and walk your talk. It's about earning your experiences and improving yourself. Authenticity is attractive because it aligns your thoughts, words, and actions.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Rich Roll:** they have something that you want, and you try to pretend that you're at their level to say whatever it is you think they want to hear from you so that they feel comfortable befriending you, it's very transparent that that is a false and shallow gesture, right? Like you can't, if you're sitting behind a microphone and you're pontificating about a whole bunch of bullshit, but it's not a result of earned experience in your own life, then it's not going to have the resonant effect that you think it would have because you didn't earn it, right? So in recovery, it means walking your talk, basically. And when you walk your talk and that talk and that walk is integrated with a value system that is slowly improving your life, then the water in your glass raises and the level of your companions will raise in lockstep with that. So I think it's important that if you want to attract a certain caliber of person into your life, then you have to your life in accordance with the kinds of values that would be attractive to that person. And as somebody who's spoken a lot about dating, this is the same thing with relationships, right? You're not going to attract that mate who is living a more aspirational life than you until you can level up your own life.

**Chris Williamson:** There's a quote from Alex Homosey that says, people are attracted to authenticity, but it's hard to define for me. Here's my best attempt. True alignment of what you think, what you say, and what you do.

###  [The Value of Offering Something to the World](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e2c3ee1b-8e56-407f-afca-c3e280eec4b2) 

🎧 36:30 - 37:48 (01:17)

The speaker reflects on their past, realizing that the world only values you if you have something to offer. They pursued careers with social and monetary value, such as modeling, club promoting, and being a DJ. They even went on reality TV shows to gain social capital. However, they question when they will realize that their worth doesn't depend on external validation.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Chris Williamson:** And I think what the undertone that that taught me was, fundamentally, the world won't love you unless you can offer it something. Because before you didn't have anything to offer it and it didn't love you. So now you need to offer it something, which is why if I look back on the career that I went through in my twenties, every single thing that I did had a shit ton of social monetary value on the other side of it. So I became a model before I came to uni. Then I kept working as a commercial model and then moved into editorial. Then I became a club promoter because people like models. People really like club promoters. You want to get in VIP? You want to skip the queue? You want to know where the prettiest girls are? You want a free bottle of champagne? You got to come through me. Okay. Then I became a DJ. DJ literally makes the crowd have this collective effervescence altogether. Then I go on two reality TV shows, right? Two reality TV shows, Blue Tick on Twitter, free charcoal toothpaste, full works. Because maybe if I can accrue sufficient social capital, the world will actually believe that I'm worth something.

**Rich Roll:** And where and at what point did you have a reckoning with that? Where did the bottom fall out on that for you?

###  [The Importance of Social Capital](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7f991832-1b50-41f2-bf1a-76e3079a5293) 

🎧 36:30 - 38:13 (01:43)

In my 20s, I learned that the world only loves you if you have something to offer. So I pursued careers with social and monetary value like modeling, club promoting, and being a DJ. I even went on reality TV shows to gain social capital. But eventually, I realized that I was living a persona and wasn't being true to myself.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Chris Williamson:** And I think what the undertone that that taught me was, fundamentally, the world won't love you unless you can offer it something. Because before you didn't have anything to offer it and it didn't love you. So now you need to offer it something, which is why if I look back on the career that I went through in my twenties, every single thing that I did had a shit ton of social monetary value on the other side of it.

**Rich Roll:** And where and at what point did you have a reckoning with that? Where did the bottom fall out on that for you? So I got to the second

**Chris Williamson:** reality TV show. And what I'd been doing for a long time was playing a persona. My business partner knew who I was truly, and the guys that worked with me knew who I was truly, but largely the public facing Chris wasn't honest about his curiosity, about the person he was, but I was always able to sedate myself with distraction with YouTube

###  [The Death of Contrast](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8242180c-620a-401d-a097-ad80859a2f69) 

🎧 37:48 - 39:50 (02:02)

I went on a reality TV show and realized that the person I pretended to be wasn't who I truly was. This led me to discover my passion for podcasting. It made me realize that there was an incongruence between the person I claimed to be and my true self. This realization was the beginning of a transformative journey. Life only makes sense in reverse, but when you're facing the unknown, there is no romance or glory. It's a challenging process.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Rich Roll:** So I got to the second

**Chris Williamson:** reality TV show. And what I'd been doing for a long time was playing a persona. My business partner knew who I was truly, and the guys that worked with me knew who I was truly, but largely the public facing Chris wasn't honest about his curiosity, about the person he was, but I was always able to sedate myself with distraction with YouTube and social media and partying and girls and stuff, right? And then I go in this TV show and they take everything away from you. There's no books. There's no calls home. There's no internet, no phone, no TV, no nothing. And all that you have to do for a month is talk to people who are the hyper extroverted party people that I thought I was. dose of contrast. I saw staring me in the face, inescapable, a team of 13 other people who were the person that I'd been pretending to be for a decade. And I realized that I wasn't that. And I thought, okay, I literally can't escape this. And it wasn't that. And the skies opened. And then I realized that my true path was to become a podcaster and talk shit into a microphone. Wasn't like that, but it did make me think, right, there's something up here. Like there is an incongruence between the person you say you are and who that sort of person actually is. And that really was the beginning of it rolling downhill. But again, even with that, you said it before, like life needs to be lived forward, but only makes sense in reverse. And when you're staring into a bunch of unknown, it's, there's no romance. There is no glory medley fucking like real that you've got some cool, like Jamie Fox motivational quote over the top of it, telling you about where you're going to go. No,

###  [The Impossibility of Receiving Love](https://share.snipd.com/snip/411326e1-00b4-464c-90d2-dd0bebab1ba5) 

🎧 40:51 - 42:15 (01:23)

In order to survive, we often wear masks to avoid bullying and please others. However, this can lead to resentment and disconnection from our true selves. Seeking validation from others is empty and unsatisfying. People may love the roles we play, but not the real us, leaving us feeling alone in a crowd.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Rich Roll:** so as a survival mechanism, you have to figure out a costume or a mask to wear to avoid the pitfalls of being bullied and just survive and navigate the day. That's certainly what I did. And like you, it showed up in people-pleasing. I'm a chronic people-pleaser. Only in recent years have I really worked hard to try to deconstruct that. And it's something that is also pernicious because the lie you tell yourself is, I'm a. Like, I just want everyone to be happy. And so you got your way to make everyone else happy. But as a result of that, none of your own needs are getting met. You're developing resentment. You're disconnected from who you are. It's also, you're

**Chris Williamson:** not bothered about making them happy. You're just desperate for them to like you.

**Rich Roll:** Yes. That's the fuel underneath the whole thing. And it's an empty fuel because then you get it. It never sates the appetite though. There's a quote

**Chris Williamson:** from Aubrey Marcus where he says, the persona is incapable of receiving love. It can only receive praise. And what he means by that is if you're playing a role, any of the accolades that you get and any of the care that people give toward you isn't going to hit you existentially. It's like people don't love Russell Crowe. They love Gladiator. People don't love Chris Hemsworth. They love Thor. And this is how you can feel alone in a crowd and hollow in victory. Because

###  [The Importance of Service and Meaning in Life](https://share.snipd.com/snip/38c8340e-6964-4a9a-b285-09d4aade32a7) 

🎧 45:35 - 47:19 (01:44)

Finding meaning in life is a process. By approaching what we do with a sense of service, our lives become more fulfilling. When we get caught up in ego and stray from our values, it starts to affect our soul. Love and praise were synonymous for me growing up, as I sought love through achievements.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Rich Roll:** think that's astute. I'm glad that you found this thing. It certainly wasn't something that you could have whiteboarded in the aftermath of being on that reality show. It's a process, you know, and it's a fluid thing. And I would suggest to you that there's more. And I think the more that you can bring a sensibility of service to what you're doing, that, of wholeness, uh, and oneness. And, um, and sense of meaning in your life will only escalate. Because truly for me, it's all about service. You know, what I do as a commercial enterprise, of course, but when I get away from the service aspect of it and into the ego part of it is when I stray from my values and that hole starts to gnaw on my soul. And just to kind of go back to my version of your story, you mentioned that Aubrey quote about praise and love. And I think for me as a young person, those two things were one in the same. I lived in a house where love was essentially conditioned upon achievement. And I got good at achievement, but I did it unconsciously in search of love.

Finding something astute and meaningful in life is a process that can't be whiteboarded. By bringing a sense of service to what you do, your life will have more meaning and wholeness. Service is what truly matters, regardless of the commercial aspect of your endeavors.

###  [The search for love through achievement and the realization of unconditional love](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cb7e4856-ac9f-46c8-868c-899c3316f20c) 

🎧 47:12 - 48:28 (01:15)

As a child, I constantly sought love and validation through achievement. No matter how much I accomplished, it was never enough. It wasn't until adulthood that I realized my true desire for unconditional love. I pretended to be an athlete and academically inclined to earn praise and respect. But eventually, this facade crumbled, leading me to a profound realization: love cannot be earned, it is unconditional.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Rich Roll:** And I got good at achievement, but I did it unconsciously in search of love. And it was never enough, no matter how much I achieved, no matter how fast I swam. I was always just shy of getting it. And it wasn't until adulthood that I could reflect back on that and have some self-awareness around it. Because when you're young, your brain is informed. You don't know why you're, I'm competitive, I'm ambitious. But in truth, I just wanted to be loved unconditionally, but that was never going to happen because I was a sensitive artistic kid who had all these weird interests and would rather hide in a corner and read a book. But I adopted the persona of an athlete and, and academically inclined person. And I got the accolades and I got into all the schools and perpetuated on that hamster wheel as long as I could until the axle broke and the whole thing fucking collapsed on top of it, of me, in order to have a reckoning with it and understand that we don't have to earn love. Like love is unconditional. I've

1. The speaker reflects on feeling a strong sense of visceral suffering, which they attribute to the Puritan work ethic
2. The Puritan work ethic emphasizes suffering and punishment as a spiritual practice, devoid of any spiritual payoff
3. The speaker highlights the irony of people in CrossFit embracing suffering and discomfort while being unable to handle a lack of suffering
4. The real discomfort lies in imagining a life without suffering
5. Tim's phrase 'what if it was easy?' embodies discipline.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Chris Williamson:** Perhaps. I feel like there's probably a veneer of imposter syndrome in there too, but it felt more visceral than imposter syndrome. And it wasn't anxiety around it not happening well next time. I mean, not being good enough. It was just that I needed to suffer. And that's what this Puritan work ethic thing does, man. And it's a hell a drug, especially if you're from one of the imperial colonial powers. You can imagine in the Middle Ages, these priests and they're hoeing the ground and the sun's beating down on their back. And they're doing it in service of God. It's not about the work. It's about the suffering. And they've got a cat of nine tails and they're flagellating themselves. We're sinners.

**Rich Roll:** We're bad people. We need to be punished. Let's flog ourselves. Let's do it in the context of our work and make that a spiritual practice. But

**Chris Williamson:** without the spiritualism, without any of the spiritual payoff. And that was where I got to. And you also said two other things that I thought was really, really interesting. And this, I thought about this when I spent a bit of time in CrossFit and I saw a lot of people in CrossFit talk about, uh, suffering and discomfort and stuff. But if I told them to sit on the couch for a full week and not train, they would have completely gone crazy. And you said the real discomfort is to see what it would be like without the suffering. And Tim has this, what if it was easy line. Yeah,

**Chris Williamson:** heard you say before, the prize doesn't go to the fastest guy. It goes to the guy who slows down the least. That pressure of potential and pressure of consistency to me in all areas of life. You were specifically not talking about racing. You were talking about

###  [Taking Time for a Retreat](https://share.snipd.com/snip/277278d9-8f94-402b-854e-8b8bc7e16d7f) [[Processed]]

🎧 01:27:39 - 01:29:54 (02:14)

1. It gets easier with time and consistency.
2. Simplifying activities and treating the days as a retreat can provide a sense of grounding.
3. Trusting the team and learning to let go are important for personal growth and success.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Rich Roll:** easier even a week later. Like you really do need a lot of time. Like I needed that entire month. Like it wasn't even actually until the last week where I started to feel a little bit more grounded. What did you do? I kept it really simple. I mean, I have friends. I was in Sydney that year. I've gone to Australia twice. So I've done this every year. I've gone to Hawaii twice. And all those places I have lots of friends, lots of opportunity to do fun stuff and see lots of people and blah, blah, blah. But I really treat it like a retreat. And so I live those days quite monastically. I do what I enjoy. I'm in a tropical location. I get up, I make my morning smoothie, and then I go out and I train. I ride my bike for four hours. I go to the ocean and swim. I push myself physically. And then I come back, I eat. I go to the beach, I read, watch a movie, go to bed at 8 o'clock, try actually not to talk to anybody and to not be online. If there's any output at all, it's just in journaling with intention and those pages ultimately creating the foundation for an idea or something later. But besides that, no work.

**Chris Williamson:** What you learned about your direction or your goals or yourself through these manuaries?

**Rich Roll:** One, a very tactical level, I've learned to trust my team and that I can let go. that in and of itself, that you can take a step back and the whole castle doesn't cave in on itself and the world continues to spin and the work gets done, is incredibly comforting and empowering because it taught me that I can step away and it's not going to be a disaster.

###  [Pattern Interrupt and Identifying Opportunities- Atomic habits](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b2c4dbdd-3efd-4df6-bad2-2535d71d2dbb) [[Processed]]

🎧 01:31:00 - 01:33:15 (02:15)

1. Sometimes, pattern interrupt is necessary to identify greater opportunities
2. Direction over speed is a cognitive bias that emphasizes the importance of going in the right direction
3. No growth is possible without goals
4. Success is determined by systems and preparation, not just goals
5. Self-improvement should be directed towards a specific purpose or direction

#### 📚 Transcript

**Rich Roll:** sometimes you have to pattern interrupt in order to identify the greater opportunity or the orthogonal opportunity that you can't see when you're in the midst of the grind. There's

**Chris Williamson:** a cognitive bias, I guess, a framework, a mental framework called direction over speed. And the lesson is that if you are going in the precise right direction, regardless of how quickly or slowly, you're always making progress. If you're not going in the right direction very quickly, you can actually push yourself further away from the goal that you ultimately want. There's another insight from Chris Sparks, who is a world champion poker player and a productivity expert. And he says there can be no growth without goals. And it's a really nice counterbalance. He came out with it just after James Clear's Atomic Habits. And I would love to get those two guys together to talk about this. They don't conflict. They mesh nicely, I do think it's an important redress. As soon as James said, you do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems. As soon as he said that, I think that, and the success of the book, which was phenomenal and is in one

**Rich Roll:** of my top five. It's still like the number one New York Times bestseller. It's phenomenal. Yeah, it's a powerhouse, and rightly so, right?

**Chris Williamson:** It's one of my five books on my 100-book list that you have to read. As soon as he said, you do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems, I think people stopped thinking about goals. And he made a really great argument, which was everybody at the start line of the 100-meter race has the same goal. It's to win. So it's not the person who has the best goals. It's the person who has the best systems and preparation. And that's true. As you dig in a little deeper, it forgets about direction over speed. And this is what there can be no growth without goals that Chris meant, which is that it is just personal goal, mental masturbation for you to frenetically do self-improvement, not in service of a thing or not in service of even a direction that you're going toward. And

###  [The Toxicity of Relying on Resentment and Anger](https://share.snipd.com/snip/07fd752e-40f8-4bea-bfe5-8e78bbe79273) 

🎧 01:45:25 - 01:46:52 (01:27)

1. Using what you have is crucial for overcoming the initial challenges.
2. Relying on resentment and anger as fuel can become toxic and addictive.
3. Success can reinforce the use of negative emotions instead of seeking healthier approaches.
4. The vestigial pattern bias refers to holding onto outdated strategies that once brought success.
5. Many individuals find success by holding onto outdated strategies tightly.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Chris Williamson:** this exact conversation with Alex yesterday saying he's a big proponent of use what you have. And most people have way more resentment and anger than they do hope. Yeah. I do agree for activation energy to get yourself out of whatever the zero to one stage is. You need to use what you have because zero to one is the hardest. The first thousand subscribers, the first blog post, the first whatever it is that you do is always the most difficult one. So use what you have. The problem is if you find that that fuel source is potent, you can end up relying on it over time. And the problem is it's toxic when you use the fuel. It addiction. Correct. Yeah. Correct.

**Rich Roll:** And it has its own euphoric byproduct. When you engage with that anger, there's something exciting about that. And when you have success doing that, you're going to go back to it and you're going to go back to it. And you're going to have to run into an obstacle before you decide to change that way.

**Chris Williamson:** Yeah. I called this the vestigial pattern bias. It's technically referred to as the Einstein-Stelling effect, but basically the thing that you did when you started that gave you success, you refused to let go of when you no longer are served by it. And a lot of people find success by grasping on really, really tightly.

###  [Engaging with the Heart Mind and Overcoming Attachment to the Intellectual](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6313a681-18e1-40ce-9e2d-bcf35af54d07) 

🎧 01:49:30 - 01:51:17 (01:46)

1. There is value in engaging with the heart mind
2. Our brains are pattern making machines and we rely on our intellectual capacity to make sense of the world
3. Attuning attention to the heart is a challenging notion that requires understanding and tactics
4. Contrast in perception between individuals can highlight different approaches to living in the head or the heart
5. Personal connections can help bridge the gap between the head and the heart

#### 📚 Transcript

**Rich Roll:** think there's so much to be learned and gained from engaging with the heart mind. I, myself, as somebody, I lock myself in my head. I'm very enamored of my ideas and my ability to articulate them and write them down. And my ego loves it when I turn a certain phrase, et cetera. I get that. I understand that. And our brains are pattern-making machines. And our intellectual capacity is what we leverage and rely upon in order to make sense of the world around us and who we are. We create rules through our perception that gets processed through our mind, and that becomes the definition of ourselves and what the world is and the expectations that we have of others. To mute or quiet that and instead attune your attention to the heart is a very esoteric and challenging notion to even understand. What does that mean? Or what exactly, what's the tactic? Like, how do I do that? You're back in your mind already, right? Was there a page in Tools of Titans about this? Yeah, know, right? So what's interesting about this is my wife is like all in her heart. And I think with certain men, I'm perceived as somebody who is very heart-centered, but my wife looks at me as a guy who lives entirely in my head, because the contrast between us is pretty significant. And she's been an amazing teacher in helping me to make that connection that I find so
