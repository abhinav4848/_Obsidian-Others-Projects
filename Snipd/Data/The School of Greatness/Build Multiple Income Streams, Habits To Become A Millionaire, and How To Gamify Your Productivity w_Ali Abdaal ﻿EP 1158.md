###  [Transitioning from Doctor to Building Multiple Streams of Passive Income](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e9727348-caa8-4b74-97da-61ceef15691a) 

🎧 04:16 - 05:49 (01:33)

Lois, it's great to be on your podcast. I've been a long-time fan of your work and admire the high quality of everything you do. It's an honor to be here. I've seen your explosive growth in recent years as well. I'm curious about how you made the transition from being a doctor to building multiple streams of passive income. I believe everyone desires this kind of income.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** everything you do is just so high class and high quality. So it's a real honor to

**Lewis Howes:** be on. I appreciate it, man. And you've been exploding over the last few years as well. And it's been cool to watch your growth. You talk about productivity, you about passive income and many other things. But what I'm curious about is how you've kind of transitioned from a traditional career of being a doctor to really building multiple streams of passive income on the side, which I'm assuming has kind of surpassed your career income many times over now. And I believe that everyone wants to have this passive income coming in in their life. They would like to have a few hundred dollars coming in or a few thousand dollars or even more every single week or month. And you've done this successfully. You've created multiple passive streams of income. And I'm curious, what were the keys for you to switch your mindset from just having one stream of income with your career to having passive multiple streams of income?

**Ali Abdaal:** Yeah. So I think I can probably trace it back to when I was 17 years old, and I first read the four hour workweek, and came across the idea of passive income. And immediately, my mind was blown. And I could, you know, it's that it's, it's sort of like, in, in there's like, like, like Japanese animes, when like, the good guy gets this like special power, and suddenly they can see like all the chakras around them. It was sort of that that kind of moment where I had just by default been following the traditional path of just assuming that, okay, you know, I'm going to be a doctor, I'm going to make money, and then I'm going to hopefully ascend the hierarchy and eventually make enough money to buy a bigger house and then retire.

###  [A transformative moment and the parable of the Mexican fisherman](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6664f5a7-ad05-4054-bd92-1f00a33d29fd) 

🎧 05:00 - 06:51 (01:50)

My mind was blown when I read 'The 4-Hour Workweek' and it made me question my assumptions about a traditional career path. I decided to pursue medicine for fun and focus on building multiple streams of passive income. The book also introduced me to the parable of the Mexican fisherman, which emphasizes the importance of prioritizing immediate happiness and family over wealth. It's a story that has stuck with me.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Lewis Howes:** passive streams of income. And I'm curious, what were the keys for you to switch your mindset from just having one stream of income with your career to having passive multiple streams of income?

**Ali Abdaal:** Yeah. So I think I can probably trace it back to when I was 17 years old, and I first read the four hour workweek, and came across the idea of passive income. And immediately, my mind was blown. And I could, you know, it's that it's, it's sort of like, in, in there's like, like, like Japanese animes, when like, the good guy gets this like special power, and suddenly they can see like all the chakras around them. It was sort of that that kind of moment where I had just by default been following the traditional path of just assuming that, okay, you know, I'm going to be a doctor, I'm going to make money, and then I'm going to hopefully ascend the hierarchy and eventually make enough money to buy a bigger house and then retire. And I just hadn't really considered any of those assumptions until I read Four Hour Workweek. And then from that point on, it seemed to put a terminology on something that I'd sort of been feeling anyway, that maybe just the traditional career path of medicine, maybe it wasn't quite for me, but it was reading that book, The Parable of the Mexican Fisherman, which he talks about as well, that made me realize, okay, what I really want to do is I want to do medicine for fun. And then I want to make enough money to sustain myself through multiple streams of income. And so from my first year of med school onwards, when I was 18, I decided, okay, this is going to be the path. And that was then my hobby in the evenings when I wasn't writing an essay or studying for an exam or hanging out with friends. I'd be tinkering away at websites and trying to slowly, slowly, slowly build these streams of passive income.

**Lewis Howes:** Really? And can you explain for those who have not read the far work we get, can you explain the parable of the Mexican fisherman? Oh,

**Ali Abdaal:** certainly. The parable of the Mexican fisherman is one of my favorite stories.

###  [The Importance of Problem-Solving in Entrepreneurship](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c34050e7-df26-4748-aa9f-08f4371cf2ec) 

🎧 13:17 - 14:50 (01:33)

When coming up with startup ideas, it's important to find a problem that you personally experience and think about how to solve it. For example, if you find it difficult to get a taxi, you could create an app that connects taxis with people who need rides. This is where coding skills can come in handy, as they allow you to turn an idea into a functional prototype. Coding can seem daunting, but it's worth learning if you want to create profitable businesses. If you didn't learn coding, what other skill would you have pursued for passive income?

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** that it so so the first one is that if you if you get an idea then then you can just build it over the weekend and ship it and it can do quite well i think the other the other thing of it is again like when when you learn to code it unlocks an aspect of your brain and opens up your mind to ideas that you just wouldn't have had before. Really? So explain. So for example, let's say I were to, generally when people talk about coming up with startup ideas, they say that you shouldn't just try and sit down and think of a startup idea. You want to find a problem in the world, preferably a problem that you're having yourself, and then think about how you might solve that problem. So let's think a few years ago, let's say you were to think, you know what, it's a real pain in the bum trying to get a taxi because, you know, the taxis are expensive, they don't take card, you know, it's an absolute nightmare. Now, if you're not a coder, you think, okay, this is a problem. I wish someone solved it. But if you're a coder, you think, huh, this is a problem. Hmm, right. What would it take to solve this problem? Well, I guess all we really need is a middleman app that connects taxis with people who want taxis. And I suppose you could build that by essentially making a database, by having one table of taxi drivers, having one table of passengers, be a field of figuring out some kind of integration with Google Maps API, figuring out some kind of payment system, maybe using Stripe. And all of a sudden, you've built a very prototype version of Uber or Lyft in your head, because you know how to code. And if you don't know how to code, you just wouldn't, your mind wouldn't even go in that direction. But if you do, it does. And that is where a lot of the most interesting and most profitable businesses over the last like two decades have come from people who know a

###  [Making Money on YouTube: How Adsense Revenue Works](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8f2f44be-0418-497d-9af1-dd37891defe4) 

🎧 22:19 - 23:56 (01:36)

YouTube AdSense is the third biggest source of income, generating $40,000 to $50,000 per month. The majority of the earnings come from older videos that continue to generate revenue. Making YouTube videos is seen as an investment, similar to real estate or crypto, where the effort put in initially results in continuous income. With around 400 videos on the channel, each one contributes a few dollars daily, amounting to a monthly income of $30,000 to $50,000. It wasn't always profitable, but after five years of consistency and turning on ads, the money started rolling in.

🎧 23:25 - 24:43 (01:18)

The narrator didn't make money from YouTube for the first five years, as they didn't turn on ads and wanted to provide free value. However, after turning on ads a year and a half ago, they saw the payoff of years of work and are now getting paid for their past efforts. Unlike other social media channels, YouTube is evergreen and provides ongoing returns, unlike timely trends that quickly disappear.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Lewis Howes:** an effective clean that's gentle on skin while removing impurities like dirt and body oil without leaving irritation residues. Plus, All Free Clear liquid is Safer Choice certified by U.S. EPA for a clean you can feel good about. All you need is All Free Clear.

###  [Enjoying the Process of Podcasting without Making Money](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3b9cbe34-c677-4a0f-98a2-7d56e54ab471) 

🎧 27:30 - 28:22 (00:51)

Even when you're not making money, it's important to enjoy the process of creating something. Starting his podcast with the goal of providing value to others, the speaker focused on learning and improving rather than making money in the first year.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Lewis Howes:** you're not monetizing it. So that's why I like YouTube as a platform, because it's evergreen. You know, it doesn't have to be like this new timely trend thing that goes away in two days and no one sees on your stream. Yeah,

**Ali Abdaal:** think that's one of the great things about YouTube. we kind of we've we've touched on again, we're like one of the secrets of passive income, which is that it really is just about adding value consistently over a very, very, very long time. And then you just kind of automatically make money. You don't even have to think about it very hard if you're doing stuff like YouTube. And I think one mistake I see a lot of people make is that they focus on the income side of it too early. And they don't recognize that ultimately money is just an exchange of value. And so if you can show up, you know, week after week, like you've been doing for the last eight years, then you, of course, you're make money. Like you would not make money. The more value you add to the world, the more the market rewards that.

###  [Finding Joy and Value in Creating Content](https://share.snipd.com/snip/32becb82-1903-4ae1-bbe2-b8275891c51e) 

🎧 29:28 - 30:13 (00:44)

Doing something fun that adds value to others is the key to making money in the long term. The possibility of monetization was always in the back of my mind when starting my YouTube channel. The dream was to reach four thousand subscribers in the first year and make ten dollars a month from ads.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** internet, the zero cost of distribution, the zero cost of reproduction. And so, you know, if initially people, you know, initially my med school admissions business started because people were coming to me and I was offering them tutoring on how to ace their med school interviews. And then I thought, you know what, let's productize this into a course. And then I would teach a course and now I can teach it to 30 people at a time. And it's still trading my time for money, but it's now at a greater scale. And then the next step is, okay, let's take my time out of it. Let's hire someone else to teach instead. Let's build a team around it. And then let's turn it into an online course where now I've done the work once and I never have to do it ever again. And so I think that sort of way of thinking is one habit that's really helped over time. I think another one, which is a bit like underrated in this

###  [The Impact We Make](https://share.snipd.com/snip/31078fd4-fffb-4c90-96a9-af33d33498cd) 

🎧 33:10 - 34:37 (01:26)

The excitement and passion of being in the top charts and creating opportunities are great, but what really drives me is the impact we make on people's lives. Hearing testimonials of how our strategies have transformed lives keeps me motivated. We're here to serve and add value to others, and that's the golden ticket. And if you can make money doing something you enjoy and adding value to others, then we're really onto something.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** something from, from, from, from YouTube. And so I just didn't really consider the monetization side of it very much, other than kind of content marketing for my existing business. But I think that's like, again, one of the main habits that helps with this stuff. Like, either you're lucky enough to stumble upon something that's just intrinsically fun by default. So actually, like for me, making YouTube videos was pretty fun in the early days, in particular, because you're creating something and you're getting instant feedback and you're seeing a sense of progress. And these are all things that we know the research tells us and personal experience tells us these are all things that make an experience more fun. like how do we keep it fun um and find ways to make it more fun so like building progress and building a sense of accomplishment and doing it with friends i found that making up friends with other youtubers engaging more with the community really thinking about how i could help people all of these were very deliberate things i did to make sure it was fun over the long term because otherwise i would have just burned out from doing it right

**Lewis Howes:** exactly and it's something i you know i've been doing this for eight and a half years now, and I've done 1150 episodes. And so you've got to, you know, I've had to learn how to continue to keep it interesting and fun doing the same thing over and over because consistency is one of the keys to long term success is like you showing up consistently, like you did 400 videos. That's consistency over time. And enjoying

###  [Tracking Growth and Impact: Serving More People](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4dc9e524-899c-480f-9dd0-2c32482dda79) 

🎧 36:12 - 37:28 (01:16)

Tracking and measuring growth in a business can be healthy and exciting. For me, it's not about comparing myself to others or gaining subscribers for personal satisfaction. Instead, I focus on how we can serve more people and make a positive impact on their lives. Recently, we gained 70,000 new subscribers, which means 70,000 potential lives we can touch. We aim to serve a hundred million people weekly and help them improve their quality of life. Our mission is to overcome challenges, provide peace, love, and growth to individuals.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Lewis Howes:** viral and this audio is really doing well and we're in the top charts and, you know, all the opportunities that we can build and create and come from it. Also, probably the thing that keeps me most excited, if I'm really thinking about it, those all good things, but the thing that keeps me most excited and passionate and driven is the impact we make. And every week we talk about on our team calls, we talk about the testimonials or the reviews or the life-changing messages that people write in, whether it be YouTube comments or on a podcast review or on an email or whatever it may be, how one moment or one thing they listen to or one thing they watch, they implemented, whether it be from me or one of the experts we've had on, they implemented that strategy and something transformed in their life. They got out of a toxic relationship. They finally got the divorce after 10 years of thinking about it. They had the courage to go ask the person out. They stopped smoking. They got healthy again. They started sleeping better. They went to therapy, whatever it is. And they say, thank you for this moment. It helped me improve the quality of my life. And that's what really drives me is like, okay, we're here to serve people. We're here to add value to people. And I think, again, if you do something you enjoy that also adds value

###  [The Importance of Continuous Growth and Evolution](https://share.snipd.com/snip/55221fa6-09ab-488f-9700-cf159aeeb463) 

🎧 37:28 - 38:50 (01:22)

It's exciting to have a team committed to our mission of serving and reaching more people. We want to keep growing and serving at a higher level. We need to develop new skills, let go of limiting beliefs, and think in different ways. Sometimes there are ups and downs, like revenue and subscribers decreasing, but that's part of the natural evolution. We can't always be in a constant state of growth, we also need to contract and breathe out. Just like the human body.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Lewis Howes:** to someone or someones, then that is the golden ticket in my mind. And if you can make money with it, then now we're really talking.

**Ali Abdaal:** I'm just really curious about this. How do you combat that thing? So when it comes to my YouTube channel, one problem that I have is that I feel like I'm constantly chasing more, like more subscribers, more revenue, more success. I often think like what's the what's the point uh but and you know a few years ago if someone had told me i'd be on two million subscribers i would have had a stroke because it's just completely completely outside of the world of possibility but now it's like oh two millions it's good but like three million would be like i

**Lewis Howes:** know but like there's one of your friends have 10 million you know it's like Yeah,

**Ali Abdaal:** exactly. How do you think about like the pursuit of more?

**Lewis Howes:** Well, I think the universe is always expanding. I think we're designed to grow. I think we're meant to evolve and develop and grow ourselves, whether it be with wisdom or experience or, you know, our health. We're meant to grow, in my opinion. And if we're not growing, then we're slowly dying. And if a business is not growing, then it's eventually going to be out of business. If your health is not improving the quality of growth in a healthy way, then eventually your body will be out of business, out of commission. It'll get sick. It'll

🎧 45:51 - 46:54 (01:02)

Imagine if famous TV doctors stopped practicing medicine and focused only on their TV shows. It would be scary for them to give up being a doctor because their brand and identity are tied to it.

You know, it's kind of like what we did that year. And I remember I got one gift from, and my brother was like choosing me as his, you know, picked me out of the hat and he got me the gift. And he didn't even wrap the gift. He's like a very tough, like, here you go. I hope you enjoy it. He just gave me a book in a bag that he got from Barnes& Noble. And he said, here you go. And it was the four-hour work week. And I remember, you know, he got a guy who's

###  [The Fear and Insecurity of Career Prestige](https://share.snipd.com/snip/db3d4fb1-342d-41b3-8c0e-24b4f53c7ab4) 

🎧 01:04:59 - 01:06:15 (01:15)

I'm already beyond the point where I would need a million dollars in the bank to feel financially secure. It's not about the money, but rather the fear, prestige, and status anxiety that comes with investing so much time in a specific skill. There's also the insecurity of whether I have value outside of my profession. Can I talk about productivity without being a doctor? How long can I rely on the reputation of my fancy university? Ultimately, my main concern is who I am and who I admire, such as YouTubers like Peter McKinnon, Matthew Vella, Thomas Frank, and Tim Ferris.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** Then over time, especially after I discovered the four hour work week, it was a case of, okay, you know, I think the way I think about it these days is that, and I'm kind of reflecting on this based on what you just said, that the way I think of money is that we all need to tick the box of making enough money to survive through some something or another. For most of us, that's through our day job, through our day job, we make enough money to live off. And then we do our the stuff we actually enjoy in the evenings and in the weekends. And for me, it always a case of okay, I never want to be in that position where I am shackled to a job that I might not necessarily enjoy, just for the sake of that money, which was then the mindset that made me develop all these streams of income. And at every junction thinking, okay, how do I turn this into another income stream? How do I do it that way? And the thing that actually sparked this, so four-hour work week was one of them. But then since I got into med school, every time I would meet another doctor, I would ask the question that, hey, if you were to win the lottery, would you still do medicine?

###  [Causes of Procrastination: Short Term Gains and Idealized Future Selves](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1efe5ea3-cee9-4a9d-860d-f87ab106a753) [[Processed]]

🎧 01:25:28 - 01:28:53 (03:24)

The main causes of procrastination are expedential discounting over time and our idealized perception of our future selves. We tend to prioritize short term gains and find it difficult to motivate ourselves for long term benefits. Additionally, we often put off tasks because we believe our future selves will have more energy and motivation. To combat procrastination, we should make tasks easier, clearly define them, and add an element of fun. This will help eliminate procrastination and improve productivity.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Lewis Howes:** human beings. Like, oh, I had this open window and I should have this. I should have done more of this. I should have created that. Why do we as humans tend to do that? Is that just kind of social pressure you think? Is that the way our culture has been built on being the most efficient and productive people we can be? Is that because we're always obsessed with wanting to buy more things or make more money? Why do you think we're wired that way as humans in general? Not everyone, but it seems like a lot. Yeah,

**Ali Abdaal:** this is an area I'm doing a lot of reading around. I think for me personally, it's fear- as we've kind of just talked about it's if i don't keep on running at 120 miles per hour someone will overtake me and then that would be bad because then i will suddenly lose all my subscribers and all my revenue and all my income streams overnight and it goes into a completely irrational loop of, I need to constantly be on my A game and constantly be moving because similar to the stuff that, you know, that I believe that if you're, if you're not growing, you're dying. It's like, oh, okay, but I could be growing faster and I could be, I'm leaving money on table and I could be building even more of a safety net because in case I lose the job, I'll have 30 years worth of savings rather than 20 years worth of savings. That's, that's probably what it is for me um yeah i haven't i haven't yet done enough reading to figure out to try and understand what it's like what it's like for other people do you do you have that feeling at all that stripe or did you in the past yeah

**Lewis Howes:** i think i did in the past where i was i was broke on my sister's couch for about a year and a half trying to figure, you know, and I didn't have, I didn't think I had skills or tools to make money. And so I was like, okay, what am I to do with my life? Luckily, my sister let me stay for a year and a half rent free. And I kind of ate all our food for free. And I didn't, you know, while I was learning these things, this is when I was like reading blogs, you know, reading for our work week and trying to implement these things, studying other thought leaders and the content they were creating. This is when I was doing kind of like local networking events and started learning events. I was inventing a product. And I remember in 2008, I was using Alibaba.com. And I was like sent over this janky design to a few different people in China. And then I remember like all the money I had, I think it was like 160 bucks. It was like all the money I had. I wired it to some bank in China. And I was like, hopefully they send me the prototype. And I think it was like four weeks later, I got like this box. And it's like the most incredible. I was like, I got it. My idea is here. It arrived. and um you know it's definitely needed more work and prototypes and this and this and i continued down the path but it was like i didn't i didn't have any money and i remember every dollar mattered for that year and a half window like every dollar was going towards food or was going towards like something to help me improve and when when i had feeling, I can't speak for everyone else, but when I had that feeling and I started to make money, I did not want to go back to that place. I was saving everything. I, I was just like, I was, if I had to travel, I was in the middle back seat of the cheapest airline with as many connections, or I took a Greyhound bus places, or I never paid for a hotel room. I remember it wasn't until like five, six years ago when I actually paid for my own hotel room. I was like, who do I know?

🎧 01:29:06 - 01:30:42 (01:36)

If you want to make life more enjoyable, treat it like a fun game. Take breaks to prevent burnout, but always come back to the game. Distractions are a challenge, but setting small tasks and time limits can help eliminate them.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Lewis Howes:** money for something else and just try to meet people and crash. I remember I was literally kicked out of a hostel that I was paying like, I don't know, $8 for a night in Philadelphia. It was like 20 bunk beds in one room and they somehow double booked my bunk bed whatever. And they had to kick me out that night. And I remember walking the streets of Philadelphia with my suitcase. I was waiting to go back on the Greyhound bus to get back to Ohio later the next day. And I was like, I'm either going to sleep in the sidewalk on a bench in a city that I'm not familiar with, or I got to meet someone and go find a place to crash. I went into a bar. I kid you not. I went into a bar. I don't drink alcohol, but I went into a bar and I started having conversation with this group of people telling what I'm up to, just like building a rapport. And within 30 minutes, they were like, Oh, why don't you come crash on our futon? Stay the night. I literally stayed in some stranger's futon, got up in the morning, left, went to the bus station, and then drove back. And it was just about how can I be as resourceful as possible? Because I was afraid to go back to a place of being broke. And for years, I was afraid of that. Probably wasn't until about four years ago. I was like, okay, I know I can make money again if I lose it all. It's going to be okay. So I understand position. But I also wasn't as far along as you are, you know, within the first few years of getting started, you know, of the YouTube growth and everything else. So you're much farther along financially than I was in those first couple of years. Yeah.

###  [Distraction and the Fun Factor: How to Stay Focused](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1b20272f-a073-43bb-8ecd-cb38a7a81676) 

🎧 01:30:42 - 01:31:48 (01:06)

One approach to avoiding distraction is to disconnect from technology, but the speaker prefers to make tasks enjoyable and engaging. They still use strategies like keeping their phone face down and on do not disturb mode when they need to focus. The speaker believes that making tasks fun is key to reducing distraction and suggests a framework called GAMEs: gamification, autonomy, mastery, environment, and socialization.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** Lots to ruminate about after this call i appreciate you pushing me on this this is really really useful of

**Lewis Howes:** course um what um so we got these three areas of procrastination distraction and burnout what do you think is the area that is the most difficult for people to overcome i

**Ali Abdaal:** think it depends on what stage of journey you're at i think if so if i do a quick back of my head poll of every message i've ever had about this procrastination is the biggest one uh why

**Lewis Howes:** do people procrastinate so much what is the main cause of procrastination? Ah,

**Ali Abdaal:** yeah. So one theory about this, which I agree with is, okay. So basically, I think it's in two parts. Number one, there's this concept in psychology called exponential discounting. Basically, if I offered you $100 now or $100 in a year's time, you would definitely take the $100 now. Even if I offered you $110

🎧 01:31:36 - 01:32:57 (01:21)

The speaker describes a five-part framework for gamification, which includes autonomy, mastery, environment, and socialization. They explain that the challenge and progress elements of gamification are addictive and can make tasks more enjoyable. The speaker suggests that incorporating these elements into everyday activities can reduce distractions and increase engagement. They also reference video game designers as experts in human psychology and advocate for learning from their techniques to make tasks more fun.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** in psychology called exponential discounting. Basically, if I offered you $100 now or $100 in a year's time, you would definitely take the $100 now. Even if I offered you $110 in a year's time, you would still prefer the $100 right now because we prefer short-term gains over long-term gains. But if I offered you like a million dollars in a year's time, you'd be like, all right, I'm going to delay my gratification right now and get the million dollars in a year's time. And if you ask enough people this question, you get this exponential curve over time where this is how much we care about our future selves compared to our current selves. And so usually when we procrastinate, it's because we have to do something right now, which is somewhat unpleasant for the sake of a long-term gain. Like, I don't want to do my ab workout right now. There's 12 minutes of pain for the sake of, oh, you know, better health 12 months from now a year from now 20 years from now it's it starts to it's like genuinely really really really hard to motivate ourselves to suffer in the short term for the sake of the long term um i think that's one like completely rational reason why people procrastinate because you just can't be bothered to do the thing that's going to have long-term results but i think also procrastination often is like putting things off oh i could do this tomorrow uh and it's weird because like again there's a bunch of evidence in psychology about this how what we think of our

###  [Shifting Perspectives: From 'I Have To' to 'I Get To'](https://share.snipd.com/snip/23d71afb-d4c8-4ba0-a28c-682691d017a5) 

🎧 01:34:57 - 01:36:27 (01:30)

A friend of mine taught me the power of language and perspective. Instead of saying 'I have to do something', he said 'I get to do something'. This simple shift changed how we feel about our tasks and brings gratitude. He takes it further, saying 'I'm blessed to do this', recognizing the meaning and purpose in our lives. This mindset shift has a positive impact on our energy and outlook.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** about redirecting your energy

**Lewis Howes:** towards things you're fun because if something's fun you never want to stop the game like you stop the game because you're like i don't know it's 3 a.m in the morning we find we got to sleep at some point so let's go to bed and then you dream about playing again and you're like let's do it again tomorrow so if you can create your life around that is like this is a fun game and i enjoy this you're not gonna feel burnout you might need like a break every now and then like okay let me take a week off and like just go i don't know, on a lake or go on a vacation somewhere and just like water ski or something. I don't know, something where you can just clear your mind, but then you can get back to the game. And if you can design your life that way, that's a pretty cool experience. That's a pretty cool journey that you get to live. So burnout, it's just like you're working on things you don't enjoy. Because you've enjoyed it, you'd want to spend more time on it. You'd obsess about it. You'd be thinking about it all day, all night. You'd dream about it. So burnout is that. Got you. So is something that's massive for so many people. Obviously because of social media and because of just whatever, games that people want to play that are more fun than the activity they want to do. How do people illuminate distraction when it's just they're constantly on their phone? It's like, do you have to put your phone in a lock, a safe somewhere in order to do that? Or are there other ways you can do that? Or is it, again, making it smaller bite-sized items that you can tackle every day, not to spend eight hours doing one thing, but really saying, okay, for the next 50 minutes, I'm going to do this. And then I'm going to be okay with what I completed.

###  [The power of 'I am' statements and affirmations](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bd6024b2-0d3a-4280-be6d-24f56dd9a7a3) 

🎧 01:43:45 - 01:45:17 (01:31)

Saying positive affirmations like 'I am joyful' and 'I am excited to learn something' can shift attitude and energy for the rest of the day. Affirmations work for many people, but I don't need them as much anymore because I consistently feel good about myself. However, when I do feel down, I know how to find support and navigate the process of self-reflection to improve and move forward.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** like just thinking about what are the ways in which again again it like a lot of it just comes down to mindset um you know even if you're there's a really good there's a really good story that i came across i think it was in some study about a uh truck driver who was doing like deliveries for fedex or something um and the way he would approach it the way he would make it fun is that he just made it his mission that the boxes were going to fit like like a tetris grid like it was going to be so in line that it was just gonna he was he's gonna be the master at that um and they talked about how he found his job so much more fun than the other fedEx drivers because, you know, he became, essentially talked himself into becoming a master of this one very niche specific craft, but that tapped into our human desire of the motivational drive for mastery. That's a big one. And then E and S are environment and social. So environment is basically how do we make our environment a bit nicer so that it's a bit more pleasant to do the thing. like like you mentioned earlier washing the dishes with music in the background is more than washing the dishes in pure silence uh adding music there's some evidence that having greenery on your desk improves creativity and focus which is why i always have a fake ikea plant having a nice desk it's just more fun working at a slightly nicer desk or at a coffee shop that we like the vibe of or at a library that we enjoy than it is not doing that. So those are just very, very simple tweaks we can make to our environment. And just recognizing that the environment we're in has such a big impact on how much we enjoy the job.

I agree, I don't feel as vision and purpose led as I'd like. I find guided meditations helpful in exploring vision. One exercise I have is the perfect day exercise, which you can find for free on my website. It involves visualizing your perfect day in detail, from the moment you wake up.

**Lewis Howes:** uh, you know, create a new YouTube video today? Is it, what are those things kind of typically? Yeah.

**Ali Abdaal:** So for me today, it's doing this podcast with you, this, this interview with you. If this was the only thing I got good on today, it would be a successful day because I get to meet you and it's fun and all that, all that jazz. Yesterday was completing the chapter outlines for my book proposal, which is due today, which I didn't manage to do, but I made more progress on them than I would have done had I not had that as my daily highlight. So it's just things like that. It's really asking what is the single thing that will actually make a difference in my life today. And sometimes that can actually be, you know what, the thing I want to do today is call my grandma or spend more time with a friend. I think I just asking that question, because I don't like to-do lists. I think of my to-do list as my to-do list instead. I don't like feeling a slave to my to-do list. So I just think I will be a slave to that one thing, just that one daily highlight. So that's technique number one. And technique number two, which is related. I feel like before you get to that,

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** suppose that's why affirmations work i've never really tried them properly but i've spoken to so many people who just love the daily affirmation thing is that something that you do at? I

**Lewis Howes:** used to do that when I didn't feel good about myself. Now I feel good about myself pretty consistently. It's hard to kind of get me off track, I think, because I've just been practicing so much for so long now. Even when I'm not feeling good about myself, I know how to get back to like a baseline where I can manage things well enough and feel okay. Or I'm in the process of like, okay, if I'm not feeling good, how can I find who's the coach who can support me and navigate this process? What exercise or type of journaling prompt do I need to do to self-reflect so I can learn from this and improve and move through it as opposed to stay stuck in this negative feeling? I still feel these challenges in my life, but I understand the value of coaching, of community support, of accountability, of self-reflection, of letting go of my ego, of feeling like I have all the answers, and having a beginner's mind around these things. So that's what's worked for me.

**Ali Abdaal:** Awesome. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. So

**Lewis Howes:** that was one thing I think I interrupted you on the second thing you were to say around time management skills.

**Ali Abdaal:** Oh, yeah, the second one.
