###  [Training the Brain with Daily Routimes](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ee61b716-0ef9-4045-ad2b-ac99b049f240) 

🎧 03:47 - 05:16 (01:28)

Establishing a routine of cold water immersion and a 10-minute priming process every morning helps to train the brain to act promptly and efficiently instead of procrastinating. This routine sets the tone for handling more challenging tasks by conditioning the brain to prioritize actions over comfort. The priming process involves changing the body state and incorporating specific activities to prepare the brain for optimal performance, emphasizing the influence of external factors on thoughts and actions.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Lewis Howes:** think I've shared with you before, the first thing I do

**Tony Robbins:** every single morning is I go in freezing cold water. And I've shared this with many people. It's not because I'm a masochist, but because it moves the length of your body, as you well know. And when you jump in, it never feels good to go in, but getting out, you feel incredible. But I do it for a different reason. I do it to train my brain to say, when I say now, it means now. When I say go, we go. I don't stand there because it's cold and go maybe in a minute when I'm ready. And I think I've shared with you before, I don't think I've ever had a morning I look forward to jumping in that water ever. But I always do it because I've trained my brain, this is how we work. And if you train your brain to do that every single day, then it'll do it on the more difficult and important things in life. But I also then I do my priming, I think you're familiar with, which is I do 10 minutes and I pick 10 minutes because if I said do 20 minutes or 30, I don't have time. But if you don't have 10 minutes for your life, you don't have much of a life. So I do this 10 minute process. And if people want to know it rather than walk through it right now, can go to Tony Robbins forward slash priming. There's a video. It's free. But the essence of it is I change my body radically and I do three things to make sure that my brain is primed. And what I mean by primed is most people think their thoughts are their thoughts, Lewis. And you and I know better because you and I have read the studies, right? Priming is a psychological principle where you think thoughts and you think yours, but very often they're created by the environment. So one example was Harvard has done multiple studies on this. And one of the studies they did was

###  [The Power of Reaching Out and Acknowledgment](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cc283693-bead-41de-8aab-1f4e9c85e8f3) 

🎧 09:49 - 11:14 (01:24)

A book called Life Force provides details on achieving energy, vitality, and strength based on individual goals and life stage. The information presented is backed by scientific research and input from experts. The recommended practices are at the forefront of current and upcoming medical advancements. Regularly reaching out to acknowledge and appreciate others' efforts can help in reducing anxiety and stress.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Tony Robbins:** my workouts what I've done to be able to have more energy and vitality and strength I just finished a book called life force it's been three years on it and in there I give all the details of what to do depending upon what your goals are and what your direction is stage of life what you're are you looking for more energy or more strength are you looking to extend the quality of your life are you dealing with a real disease? And you know, I did Money Master the Game and I interviewed, you know, at the time, 50 of the smartest people in the world financially, Ray Dalio, Warren Buffett, et cetera. This time I interviewed 167 Nobel laureates, scientists, and the greatest regenerative doctors on the face of the earth. So there's nothing in here that's my opinion. It is all science and it's stuff that you would think would happen 20 or 30 years in the future that's happening either right now or the things that are coming in the next 12 to 36 months that the FDA is currently looking at for approval.

**Lewis Howes:** I wanted to ask you a follow-up to one thing you mentioned there, which I think a lot of people don't do, which I think you do incredibly well. I've seen you do this many times. You mentioned you reach out to someone, you'll text someone, you'll send a voice note or a video message, or maybe you're calling them or just saying hi to them and telling them you're acknowledging something that they're doing well that you appreciate. I don't think that many people do this. Why is this so important for you personally? And why do you think this would help so many people get out of themselves and overcome anxiety and stress if they did this even a couple of times a week? I know

###  [Prepare for Winter, Embrace Change, and Be a Student of History](https://share.snipd.com/snip/59ea3169-6251-4543-a9fc-a4c3644f485e) 

🎧 14:00 - 15:48 (01:48)

The insight emphasizes the prediction of impending challenges like 'winter is coming,' advising people to be prepared for change and adapt to difficult times. It encourages individuals to take back control of their minds and health by learning from various experts. The speaker highlights the importance of being a student of history to understand how humanity became a dominant force on earth by making significant distinctions.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Lewis Howes:** uh two and half years ago i had a the privilege of being in your your island in fijiiji, spending about a week with a small group of people, Dean and a bunch of other guys and gals. We got to spend some time with you and you had a prediction. You said winter is coming. Yes, I did. And you, you know, Dean has told me that you have predicted many things over the last, you know, four decades in, you know, the economy and what's happening in the world and all these different crises is you're, you're kind of on the front lines of access to the most brilliant people in the world. So you, you know, what's happening before it happens. And you said to us, winter is coming. You probably knew this two years prior to that. And you said, you don't know when exactly, but it's coming soon. And then I don't know, four or five months later, it hit and hit hard for a lot of people. And it's still hitting hard, like you're talking about, over the last couple of years. And I don't think it's going to slow down anytime soon. It seems like there might be some hope and then, boom, another wave and then another wave of something, whatever it is. in the new book with all these different experts on how we can really take back control of our mind, our health in new ways to support us when the winter continues to hit. Because it doesn't seem like it's going away anytime soon.

**Tony Robbins:** You're hitting on a huge note. I'd love to plant the seed with everyone listening. And that is we're about halfway through winter. But my hope is this is the year where that part starts to change. But we're still in winter, meaning so many people have been conditioned to be fearful. So many businesses have been shut down. Our children have been kept out of school for such a long period of time that there's after effects on that. And it's also you want to be a student of history. Think of it way for a second. When did mankind really become a dominant force on earth when they made one distinction?

###  [Cycles of History: Strength and Weakness](https://share.snipd.com/snip/dbbaad94-dff2-42fb-9c8c-5ffdb48ea8d3) 

🎧 21:14 - 22:35 (01:21)

Throughout history, there is a cyclical pattern where good times lead to weak people, who in turn create bad times. These bad times then produce strong individuals who are capable of ushering in good times again. The example of the Flappers from the 1930s and 40s illustrates this cycle well, as they transitioned from weak to strong individuals due to the challenging environment they faced.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Tony Robbins:** literally looked like the world as we know it was over and this group of people like millennials or z generation a lot of people make fun of and they go there you know whatever wallflowers i forget the terms they use and then the millennials and z generation argue about you're old because you parked in the middle versus the side. I mean, it's The same bullshit was happening then. These people are called flappers. They were irresponsible. But here's history and one thought. Good times create weak people. Weak people create bad times. Bad times create strong people. Strong people create good times. That's the history of the world over and over and over again. was weak became strong because the environment demanded it. They became the heroes. And think about how different the 1930s and 40s were versus after the war 45 through 50 up until Kennedy 63. That 20-year period was what a lot of people thought was the greatest time in America. Now, certainly wasn't if you're African American. Started to become better if you're a woman. But then think about after Kennedy died and Robert Kennedy is killed and Martin Luther King is killed. Think about the 60s and the 70s, how

###  [Diversification for Success](https://share.snipd.com/snip/248ecf1d-9917-4aef-8b23-a20d78a01a2e) 

🎧 28:31 - 29:57 (01:25)

The main insight is the importance of diversification in business, especially when other businesses start to generate more revenue than the core business. The story of Tony Robbins highlights the realization that his main business required a lot of effort and had less margin compared to his friends' businesses. He then diversified his investments, which led to success and better financial outcomes.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Lewis Howes:** I

**Dean Graziosi:** would say, number one, I just wrote down, again, I love when you ask me questions I've never been asked before. Number one is his other businesses at this phase of his life make more than his core business. Really?

**Lewis Howes:** Yeah.

**Dean Graziosi:** Right? Significantly. So he's the personal brand

**Lewis Howes:** of his main business. Right. And he's running his events and books.

**Dean Graziosi:** So he told me a great story. He's dear, dear friends with Peter Guber. Wow. Right. And Peter Guber was a mentor to him. Right. And when Tony was younger, Peter Guber owns part of the Golden State Warriors and every other team. Yeah. Academy Awards. and all. Movies, everything. Dynamic, amazing man. To only know him through Tony. Right. So at a younger age Tony's you know Tony Robbins stories on the road 250 days a year he's doing five-day events seven-day events ten-day events he's speaking here speaking there on the road lives in a plane lives in a hotel right and he is he is hustling and Peter Guber invites him to go someplace Egypt or something like that on a fancy trip and he's on this plane and he said, he's on this plane and all of them, they're on their way to being billionaires, right? And he's like, man, my business doesn't have margin. I'm just like, he started thinking about how his business was so much work and so much effort. And these guys had better areas. And when he first left, was, then he diversified immediately. I invested in this, invested in that, and all of them suffered. Really? All

###  [Empower the Core Business and Reinvest Profits Wisely](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b28752ea-8929-4b41-ba27-4b7cb82c6095) 

🎧 30:31 - 31:30 (00:59)

Master the core business before diversifying, prioritize giving back, empower the core business to fund investments in other ventures, and understand the long-term growth potential by investing in diverse ventures which can yield higher returns over time.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Lewis Howes:** But don't do that until you master the

**Dean Graziosi:** core thing. Right. And so 10 years, 15 years, head down in his business, all of a sudden this thing became an incredible company that kicked out money that he could donate. He does donate a billion meals, which is insane, right? It kicked out money for next level donation. So his one philosophy is give more. Number two, another one would be empower the core business. And when that business is empowered, use those proceeds to invest in other great businesses. Yes. And now over time, that goes to the, we all overestimate what we can do in a year and underestimate what we can do five or 10. In five or 10, now he's got the funds to invest. And now those other companies make him way more than his main business, but he still empowers his main business. It's still his love. It's still his passion. It's still his child, right? It's literally, you know, RRI, which is Robbins Research International, the UP Unleashed Power, the Indate with Destiny, Business Mastery. That's his baby, but there's nothing. They don't make anywhere near the money as other things

**Lewis Howes:** do. Really?

###  [Invest Time In Your Passion](https://share.snipd.com/snip/10c444b5-1884-4a40-aa16-487fdb91551d) 

🎧 31:30 - 32:40 (01:09)

Committing time and effort to one's passion over a significant period is crucial for success. Rushing into new ventures without dedicating sufficient time may hinder progress. Building expertise and finding one's niche requires perseverance and focus. Emphasizing emotional and mental readiness before acquiring wealth is vital. Lacking financial literacy can lead to mismanagement of money, as seen in cases of sudden wealth gain.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Lewis Howes:** But he's still putting just as much time into time because

**Dean Graziosi:** it's his passion. It's his thing. And it was the machine. And I think we live in a world today where we try something for a year and go, that's not it. What's next? Oh, that's not it. What's next? Right. You need the 10,000 hours. You need the time to break the barrier and find your lane. And

**Lewis Howes:** so after 40 years, he's still doubling down on his main thing, even though it's not making the majority of money.

**Dean Graziosi:** Absolutely. So it's a great, it's a great lesson. It taught with our company at Tony and I own together, Mastermind. It's like, I'm all in on this foundational company is growing exponentially and that'll produce so many results as we move on. What

**Lewis Howes:** happens if someone gets too much money before they're emotionally or mentally ready for it? What will happen to them if they've come into a lot of money with that lack of emotional awareness?

**Dean Graziosi:** Yeah, we see it in the news all the time, right? I mean, I think that's self-aware. I why do the majority of people who hit the lotto go broke, right? They didn't have the emotional wherewithal, right? I feel bad for them and they probably get taken advantage of. They don't understand money. I mean, most people don't understand how money works. I get that. And everybody should get some financial literacy to really understand it.

###  [Wealth Beyond Money](https://share.snipd.com/snip/98144a71-d010-4620-a5d2-171fc0ed0208) 

🎧 52:17 - 53:23 (01:06)

True wealth is not solely measured by financial success, but also by the love, energy, personal growth, and positive impact one has on others. Comparing oneself to others based on financial earnings may lead to a skewed perspective on true richness. It is important to question and reflect on feelings of inadequacy or comparison, as wealth is a multifaceted concept that goes beyond monetary achievements.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Dean Graziosi:** I see your life. I'm not, this is probably not about you. I know you're doing amazing. But I see you so much richer today than when I first met you. Yeah. So much richer. I don't care if you were making 10 times the money then. You are a richer man. You are in like the love you give, the energy you give off, the every conversation I have with you, the personal work that you do. I sent you a nice audio two weeks ago about something you did. I was like, I'm so freaking proud of you. In my eyes, you might not see it. I'm using you as an example. I know this for other people. But you might say, oh, I made a little bit less this year than last year. And from the outside, I'm like, is that dude rich? But it takes time. And I just would say, when you feel that way, really question it. Like, don't just let it sit. Don't just feel it. Or, you know, because you'll be in a conversation. I know what it was like when I thought I was doing well, doing $10 million a year. And I'm like, I came from nothing. was in a trailer park. doing $10 million in gross revenue a year. I get to keep a million of that for me or two million, whatever. I'm doing amazing. And then I go sit with somebody who's doing a hundred million and it

###  [Culture of Progress vs. Culture of Comparison](https://share.snipd.com/snip/567865b0-a15d-4dd3-8250-c59f08642422) 

🎧 53:50 - 55:15 (01:25)

Embrace a culture of progress by looking back at your journey and appreciating the growth, rather than comparing yourself to others. Reflect on how far you have come and the odds you have overcome, instead of being disheartened by comparisons with more successful individuals.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Dean Graziosi:** do we not say I'm worse than them or I'm... Yeah, no, it's just real conversation, right? know. That's why I like this. This real And the fact of the matter is there's only really one way to do it, is you got to look backwards. You have to adapt the culture of progress, right? Not a culture of comparison. Oh, man. And that's not an easy one, but it's true. Because if you look back at where you were, if I look back at where we are, we grew like rockets. Yes. We're not supposed to be here. Like if someone, I barely got out of high school, didn't go to college, had dyslexia, graduated high school with nine cents in my pocket and started working on cars what statistical yeah

**Lewis Howes:** mathematical

**Dean Graziosi:** uh percentage would you give that kid to be able to and i'm blessed to be you know 0.001 yeah 0.001 like if someone gave you like i'm gonna retire my mom and i'm gonna do all these things somebody. Somebody would be like, oh, that's so cute. Go work on your collision. You know, go pound another fender. Right? So when I look back at that kid who was just dying to make a thousand bucks a week so I could take care of my mom and do that, man, I'm a rocket ship. But if I compare myself in two weeks when I see Richard Branson and go, wow, he's a billionaire. Oh, right? So culture of progress versus a culture of comparison. Yeah. There's

**Lewis Howes:** so many more questions.

**Dean Graziosi:** It takes time. It takes time, but just know all, here's what I love. You're

###  [Identifying Habits That Do Not Serve You](https://share.snipd.com/snip/40f757a7-3248-45c5-aefa-62a6549c7c9a) 

🎧 58:02 - 59:37 (01:34)

The key insight is the importance of identifying habits that do not serve you. The speaker emphasizes the impact of morning habits on mindset, suggesting that habits like watching news immediately upon waking up can put you in a reactive and defensive space, hindering innovation and creativity. Instead, the speaker recommends cultivating habits of gratitude, self-care, and positivity to start the day on an empowering and proactive note.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Dean Graziosi:** would say not identifying habits that don't serve them. Right. You know, I wrote a book on habits. So that's my glasses, right? Sometimes if you have a hammer, you'll always see a nail. For me though, if I look back at people in my life, my family, others, they didn't realize that they had habits that actually pulled them away. The habit could be waking up in the morning. And I look at everything as a habit. It be waking up in the morning and watching your news, no matter where you get your news from. Never in my life have I ever watched the news and felt empowered. So you could have a habit of waking up and watching the news. It puts you in a reactive space, in a defensive space, and you're never innovating. You're never creating. So I would look for habits. In the morning, you could wake up and just say two or three sentences of gratitude. You can get out of bed, drink a green drink and take a walk. Or you could get up, click on the news, grab your phone, look at your emails and texts, find the bad one that puts you in a bad mood and go eat, have coffee and a donut. Now, I'm not knocking one, but they're both habits. Yes. One habit makes you feel, I believe you're more on offense. Like, hey, I fed my body. I took a walk. I'm grateful to God. I prayed or whatever it is I do. Another one's like, ah, that third email for the same thing. And you believe the trials that are going on, the election that's going on. Same morning, same thing. Two completely different experiences. One says, bring the day. I got it. The other one says, what do I have to fight today? Yes. Right? That's a habit to me. So that's

**Lewis Howes:** the first one, kind of identifying them. Yeah. Number

**Dean Graziosi:** two
