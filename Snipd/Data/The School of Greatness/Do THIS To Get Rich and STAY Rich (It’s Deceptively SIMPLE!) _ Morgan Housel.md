###  [Factors leading to financial struggles](https://share.snipd.com/snip/89b2e818-2866-4471-bf35-73a120cfdd94) 

🎧 06:21 - 07:51 (01:30)

The top reasons for financial struggles are lack of luck and short-term thinking. Luck plays a significant role in success, and many successful individuals acknowledge unexpected events that led to their success. Short-term thinking leads to giving up too soon, as seen in the example of YouTube creators who gave up before making 100 videos. Endurance and perseverance are necessary to withstand uncertainty and pain in business and investing, and many people give up sooner than expected, which is normal.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Morgan Housel:** that the top things that make people broke, number one, the most important, this might seem like a cop out of an answer, it's they don't have enough luck. I mean, that's so much of it. I know so many people who would disagree with that statement. So if you do disagree with Matt, I get it. But I think, like I said earlier, in any kind of extreme success, even mine, and I would venture to say yours too, if you're really honest about connecting the dots in the past, you would say that there is this thing that happened to me that I never planned on. I did not strategize this. It just kind of happened to me. As I said, even if that thing is you were born in the right era. And so that's a big part of it that I think is too easy to ignore. The second is, I think, some form of short-termism, whatever it is. I heard this great story from Mr. Beast recently where he said when people who have YouTube channels come to him for advice, and I'm sure a of them do, he tells everybody the same thing. He says, go make a hundred videos and then come back to me. And he said that 99 of those people will give up before they make a hundred videos. And the person who actually makes it to a hundred doesn't need his advice anymore. And I think that, but the fact that 99 of them gave up is, is, I mean, that's really what it is. It's just, it's just like, do you have the endurance, if not stubbornness to keep it going? In any business endeavor, in any investing endeavor, what you're really getting paid for is to put up with uncertainty and pain. And most people, they realize that they're going to cry uncle sooner than they thought. And that's okay. I don't think it's anything to be ashamed of, but

###  [Overcoming the Comparison Trap](https://share.snipd.com/snip/529c09c6-6a0f-4004-947a-0022ac359652) 

🎧 14:04 - 15:16 (01:12)

The trap of feeling like we never have enough and constantly comparing ourselves to others is deeply rooted in society's tendency to measure prosperity relative to others. However, at an individual level, it is possible for some people to recognize this game, and choose whether to use money as a tool for a better life or as a scorecard for others. In reality, most people are not even paying attention to us, yet we often find ourselves striving to impress them.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Lewis Howes:** So even if we are going to make more money, how do we get out of this trap of feeling like we have enough, we are enough, we're making enough. Like how do we get out of that as opposed to just comparing to our peers?

**Morgan Housel:** I think there's two answers to this. At the macro, at the big level, the society level, we never will. And that's why it's in Same as Ever. It's been like this forever and always will, that everything is relative to other people. And look, if we were going to compare ourself to a family 500 years ago who had 10 kids, eight of whom died by age two, whatever it would be, like, do we have less suffering today? Of course. But still, when we are comparing how well we're doing in our prosperity, it's always relative. I think at the individual level, it is possible for some people, much easier said than done, but possible to recognize the game that's being played. And to ask yourself, do you want to use money as a tool to give yourself a better life or as a scorecard for other people to measure you by? And most of those people are not even paying attention to you to begin with. Right. And that's a big part of it. Like you wake up every morning running as fast as you can to impress strangers who are not even thinking about you.

###  [The Danger of FOMO in Money and the Pursuit of Status](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3e900d28-f183-48c0-af5d-5e965c192b5e) 

🎧 32:18 - 34:06 (01:47)

FOMO, the fear of missing out, is a dangerous trait in managing money, whether in saving or investing, as it can lead to envy and irrational decision-making. Watching others get rich fast can be misleading as it's often not sustainable, and people tend to showcase their best but not necessarily indicative of their true financial status. The American culture of 'faking it till you make it' can lead to people overspending to impress others, driven by a natural desire for status rather than genuine happiness.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Lewis Howes:** most dangerous

**Morgan Housel:** trait in money, whether it's saving or investing, is FOMO, fear of missing out. It's if you are susceptible to watching your neighbors or your friends or your co-workers get rich, and that just makes you boil with envy. And even if it doesn't feel like envy, you see it, you say, I need that as well. That is so dangerous for two reasons. One, if you watch someone getting rich fast, there's a very good chance that it's not sustainable, that there's going to be a reversion in the mean. And your friend who made 10,000% in Bitcoin, you're not going to be able to repeat that. So if you chase that after the fact, like you're in trouble. You're

**Lewis Howes:** going to lose it.

**Morgan Housel:** The second thing is how fake is probably the wrong words. I think it's innocent, but people put their best foot forward. So what they are showing you is usually not indicative of what it is. In college, I was a valet here in Los Angeles, and it always stunned me that when people would come into the hotel I worked driving a Ferrari, a Lamborghini, Bentley, when you get to know some of these people, some of them were actually not that successful. They were like a law firm associate who spent half their paycheck on a Porsche lease. And so when the fake it till you make it idea is so powerful in America that if you see, oh, that guy's driving a nice truck, I need to go get one too. Cause I'm just as smart as, I work just as hard as that guy. That's really dangerous. Cause you're not chasing their success. You're chasing their fakeness. Why

**Lewis Howes:** is that in so many of us where people feel like they need to go in debt, overspend to try to

**Morgan Housel:** impress the people that don't even care about them? I think it's very true that people are naturally wired for status and not for happiness. Really? You don't, you're like your inner soul, like your evolution does not want you to be happy, so to speak. It wants you to be successful. Why

###  [The Role of Luck in Success and Wealth](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2c7fc92d-18fb-4efd-81e6-f4f9280b71cc) 

🎧 37:31 - 38:22 (00:51)

Success and wealth are heavily influenced by luck, with luck playing a significant role as individuals achieve higher levels of success. While intelligence, hard work, and industriousness are important, luck becomes increasingly prominent as success and wealth increase. Even the circumstances of birth and timing can heavily influence one's trajectory of success and wealth. Ultimately, success and wealth are often the result of the intersection of luck and a high level of skill.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Morgan Housel:** much to success and money is around luck i think the more success and the more money the more that luck played a role with no exceptions and it's not to say that people who have extreme wealth or success were not smart, hardworking, industrious. Of course, they were all those things. But the higher you get, you can say it approaches 90% luck, 10% skill. For everybody, there's no exceptions. And even if you say something so simple about Steve Jobs was born in the United States in the middle of the 20th century. Are we going to pretend that if Steve Jobs was born in Cameroon in 1650, he would have been as successful as it was? Of course not. So like even just like the very broad macro luck of what's involved, it's huge. Now it's always when luck and an incredible amount of skill meets at the same time.
