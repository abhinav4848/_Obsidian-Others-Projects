###  [Modern Meritocracy](https://share.snipd.com/snip/00bbd73d-a8c9-401a-93ed-bd8d5ac42809) 

🎧 08:58 - 10:34 (01:35)

- Johann Kurtz believes that the definition of merit has become radically impoverished in recent Western history.
- It's been captured by a system of mass standardized testing, suppressing excellence.

#### 💬 Quote

> Our definition of merit has actually become radically impoverished in that it has been captured by a system which people are often quick to lament because they recognize that it suppresses excellence.

Johann Kurtz on the problem with our current definition of merit.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Johann Kurtz:** And my belief is that actually something has changed in the very recent history of the West. It is also not true to say that meritocracy as we now understand it built the West because modern meritocracy doesn't apply, for example, if you even go back 100 years in American history to when America was already well on the way to being the most powerful, prosperous, and populous European nation in history or really in the history of the world. America, at the turn of the 20th century, for example, was still 90% of people worked in agriculture. Most of those agricultural units were owned by the people who worked them or were employees of family farms. And then all, you know, going on, many of the most successful firms of the 20th century were these family firms. They were multi-generational family firms. And to this day, the literature shows, and I quote John A. Davis, who's a former professor at Harvard Business School in MIT, Sloan School of Management, that actually family firms in the market outcompete publicly traded firms who switch management every few years and so forth. Now, the question is, what is going on there and what else is confounding us? And basically, my contention is that our definition of merit has actually become radically impoverished in that it has been captured by a system which people are often quick to lament because they recognize that it suppresses excellence, which is a system of mass standardized testing, mass procedures

###  [Passing on Wealth](https://share.snipd.com/snip/44b5ab9b-4353-48d1-ace2-805d92d111ee) 

🎧 22:28 - 23:28 (01:00)

- Many wealthy people struggle to pass on wealth without undermining the work ethic that earned them their wealth.
- Johann Kurtz suggests it is hypocritical to avoid giving children resources due to a fear of them not striving for greatness, because you should strive for the best things in life too.

#### 💬 Quote

> I'm tempted to disinherit my child because they don't seem, I can't see how to give them all I have without removing their incentive to work. But I don't think that answer is quite good enough. I think we need to try harder.
> — Johann Kurtz

Johann Kurtz on the dilemma of passing wealth to children

#### 📚 Transcript

**Johann Kurtz:** They have a lot in terms of wealth, they've achieved a lot in terms of social mobility, what they've earned, what they've gained, but they're not really sure how to pass those things onto their children without corrupting, without undermining the very thing which served them well, which was the work ethic, which gave them those things in the first place. So I am sympathetic to people who say, you know, I'm tempted to disinherit my child because they don't seem, I can't see how to give them all I have without removing their incentive to work. But I don't think that answer is quite good enough. I think we need to try harder. I mean, I think what I say in the book is, if you're concerned that your child is going to be given something and will shy away from an appetite for greatness, nonetheless, for the very best things in life, then it is hypocritical to attempt the same thing. I you are now in control of these tremendous resources, and you must strive to the very best things in life. And really what built the

###  [Meaningful Family Vessel](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6959e456-741c-4c5c-ba6c-b23a53033e75) 

🎧 30:43 - 31:25 (00:42)

- Don't reason from first principles about every aspect of our lives because it's exhausting.
- Johann Kurtz desires his family to be proud and understand his choices and the legacy they hope to leave.

#### 💬 Quote

> I want the actual vessel of my family to be a concept which contains meaning, which contains definitions and values and structure, because it's only when that's the case that it's something that I can associate with.
> — Johann Kurtz

Johann Kurtz on family legacy

#### 📚 Transcript

**Johann Kurtz:** But I don't think that means that we should, exactly as you say, be required to reason from very first principles about every aspect of our lives because it's exhausting. And there is no guarantee that we will end up making decisions or even deploying decision-making frameworks that are in any way intelligible to the people closest to us. Like, I want my mother, I want my father to be proud of who I've married. I want them to understand why I married them, what I see in them, how they hope that we will form a family together and what the legacy we are likely to leave together is and what that is going to mean to my parents and how that continues the legacy that their parents left to them. I want the actual vessel of my family
