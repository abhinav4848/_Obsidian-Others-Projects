###  [The Importance of Making a Difference and Collecting Experiences](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d965bf02-a086-4c45-b4e2-8dac97fe85f6) 

🎧 03:34 - 04:58 (01:24)

A desire to make a difference on a larger scale is inherent in people, especially millennials. While some may mock the idea of collecting experiences over possessions, it is important to truly invest in those experiences. Living a variety of experiences is key to staying young and fulfilled. Aging successfully means always striving for a future that surpasses the past.

#### 📚 Transcript

I think a desire to make a difference on a bigger scale or a desire to see something on a bigger scale is something that is connected to us. And maybe it's not there universally, but it is something that has always been there for me. There is a stereotype among my generation, I being a millennial, that we understand that we want to collect experiences and not things. And we can make fun of that, after all, collecting a bunch of experiences can just become a bunch of more things. I love passport stamps, for example. And I always have to ask myself, am I just collecting passport stamps as another thing or am I really genuinely investing into the experiences that those passport stamps represent in terms of reality? But we want to enjoy experiences, want to live a variety of experiences. And it seems to me that one of the reasons people get old before their time is they stop living, meaning they stop going after adventure, they stop pursuing goals that are important to them. They take the easy road and that seems foolish to me. And so one of the ways that I believe that we age successfully is to always make our future bigger than our past. And that's something that we have to define for ourselves. And for me, one of the ways that I myself want to

###  [The Power of Absence: Appreciating Loved Ones and Experiences](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8284c477-1426-436b-8a9d-98b00e310792) 

🎧 13:01 - 14:21 (01:20)

Absence makes the heart grow fonder, as we appreciate loved ones more after being apart. Intentionally experiencing deprivation or change can deepen our appreciation for things. For example, fasting from certain foods and then reintroducing them helps us value them more. In four-season climates, there is a heightened experience of life based on seasonal changes. In warm places like Florida, this is more obvious when visiting colder climates in summer, where people passionately embrace the good life knowing winter is on the horizon.

#### 📚 Transcript

We have the proverb that absence makes the heart grow fonder. It does. Because when you're taken away from the people that you love, you appreciate them more when you come back into context with them. And for this reason, I think it's helpful to intentionally insert times of deprivation into our life or times of change. We can do this in different ways. We can fast, in some way, shape or form from food or certain forms of food. Then when we reintroduce those forms of food to ourselves, we appreciate them more deeply. I see this myself very distinctly in four-season weather cultures, climates. Having grown up in Florida, where we don't have four seasons, we have two seasons, one of the things that is so obvious to me is when I travel to a four-season climate, there is a much more intense experience of life based upon the seasonality. When you go to a cold weather climate at higher latitudes and it's summertime, there's this intense jwadevivre, this intense pursuit of the good life that everybody seems to feel in the summer. You know that winter is coming. You know the cold, long, gray, rainy days are coming. So you get out there and you really enjoy it.

###  [The Benefits of Incorporating Seasonal and Global Activities into Our Lives](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8068cd57-a310-411f-b926-e63fbad5fba1) 

🎧 15:15 - 16:35 (01:20)

Experience the joy of different activities in each season and incorporate variety into life. From winter to springtime to summer, each season offers unique sports, endeavors, and experiences. Embrace the richness of life's seasons and savor them while they last. As wealth increases, some become snowbirds, enjoying summers up north and winters in Florida. Incorporating this variety into our own lives can bring a fresh perspective. Consider global relocations and having multiple homes around the world. Let's admire and adopt the lifestyle that embraces different activities at different times, bringing excitement and fulfillment.

#### 📚 Transcript

Then you have your winter activities, your springtime and your summer activities and being someone from a subtropical climate, to me, it's so obvious that that is a superior way to experience life, that mixture of the familiar with the new and different. Knowing that this season has its whole set of activities, its sports, its endeavors, its experiences, and I'm going to savor them for the three months that I have to savor them and then they're going to be gone and I have to wait a whole year for them to get around. But then there's a whole other series of activities to look forward to. So why shouldn't we incorporate more of this into our life? We do. We do. As people's wealth increases, sometimes they become snowbirds. That was common where I'm from. We have lots and lots of snowbirds live in the north during the summer, usually springtime summer fall and then during the winter they come to Florida. What a great way to enjoy certain aspects of your life differently at different times. Maybe you have your global relocation, you spend time in two or three homes around the world. Why not incorporate more of that into our own lives? The careers that I've always admired have had this as well.

###  [The Power of Personal Visits in Finding Opportunity](https://share.snipd.com/snip/65549e5b-cf2f-4fdd-b400-227d5d292a9d) 

🎧 27:40 - 28:59 (01:18)

As someone interested in internationalization and optimization, I feel compelled to explore opportunities outside of the United States. Despite the negative perceptions of our country, I want to see for myself if there are better opportunities elsewhere. No amount of research or knowledge can replace the powerful impact of a personal visit. While a personal visit is strengthened by good study and data, it remains unparalleled in its ability to truly understand a place.

#### 📚 Transcript

It's another thing if you've gone out looking for opportunity and you've either found it more in other places, or you've then come back to the United States and discovered that it genuinely is the land of opportunity. And so because of my interest in the world of internationalization and all the great newsletters and books and things that I have read over the years extolling the praises of this region or that region or this city or that city. And because as Americans we're very good at seeing the worst in our country and thinking about how much better it used to be, etc. I feel like I owe it to myself. Feel like I owe it to my children to go out and check it out. Let me go check it out. See what the opportunity is in different places. Go and see it for myself. There's nothing in the world that can replace the power of a personal visit. I don't care how learned you are. I don't care how much you've learned about or how much you've seen. There's just nothing that replaces the power of a personal visit. Personal visit is more powerful when it's buttressed by good study, good examination, good data, etc. But there's nothing that replaces the power of a personal visit. And so as someone who cares a lot about optimizing, as
