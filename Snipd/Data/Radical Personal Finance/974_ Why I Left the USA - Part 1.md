###  [Dagestan Russia: Israeli Citizen Detained by Russian Muslims on Flight](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8aad01a3-8ab3-40e5-aa60-12cfba40bb9a) 

🎧 15:59 - 17:23 (01:23)

In Dagestan, Russia, a group of Russian Muslims intercepts a plane from Tel Aviv and interrogates a man with an Israeli passport. This incident highlights the challenges of international travel and reminds us of the hijacking of Pan Am Flight 73 in 1986, where a brave flight attendant named Neerja Bhanot had to collect all the passports.

#### 📚 Transcript

Dagestan Russia, something like that, where the local population of, I think, Russian Muslims finds out that there is a plane flying from Tel Aviv to their city and they go and they stop the plane to basically way lay anybody who has an Israeli citizenship. And here they are taking away a guy with a mob, a bang for blood, a guy who's got an Israeli passport, unbelievable. And so this stuff hits close to home in terms of your ability to come and go internationally. You're ability to move around the world freely. And there have been many times, well, right now, it's easy for me to travel with a U.S. passport. And I'm grateful for that. There have been many times in which that's not the case. Just recently, I was reminded of the story of the hijacking of Pan Am Flight 73 back in 1986. And there was a heroic flight attendant named, I don't know how to pronounce her name, near Jibannat, who she had to go, she was told she did a bunch of things, but she was told to go and collect all of the passports of all of

###  [The Concerns of Pursuing a Low Cost of Living](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3ea02d78-66cd-4734-a5c3-eb6117d72a09) 

🎧 29:47 - 31:10 (01:22)

Leaving the hustle and grind too early can lead to low energy and less appealing prospects. Instead of simply pursuing a low cost of living, it's important to focus on improving skills, increasing earnings, and building connections. Money is attainable, so instead of complaining about the cost, take action to acquire more. Lower cost of living wasn't a reason for my departure.

#### 📚 Transcript

And that's really concerning. And you look at it and say, well, but wasn't I better off? Well, sort of. But you walked away from the hustle and grind way too early. And now the idea of going back to the hustle and grind is very, it's just not as appealing. You don't have as much energy. You've got more demands on you, et cetera. And so I get really concerned about people just pursuing low cost of living for its own sake, especially on a long term basis versus buckling down and improving their skills and increasing their earnings, working hard or building the connection, building the business, et cetera, that can support a higher cost of living. And I keep a sign on my wall. I'm not in front of my wall right now, but basically it says something like, it's not expensive. You just can't afford it. And that's your problem. All right, it's not expensive. You just haven't made it cheap and it's your problem. So fix it. Fix that. Don't complain that it costs too much money. Be upset that you don't have more of it. Money is relatively straightforward to come by. And so if you can go get some, then you can fix some of those issues. And so I don't want to labor on that today, but it is a concern. So lower cost of living is not one of the reasons that I myself left.

###  [The Impact of Confirmation Bias on Our Beliefs](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5416a42d-8183-49bb-a552-688146e0f0d5) 

🎧 40:36 - 41:53 (01:17)

He refuses to admit he's wrong and only sees confirmation of his viewpoint. We see what we believe, so we must be careful in forming our beliefs. It takes skill to dissociate from beliefs and study something factually. We can develop this skill. While I try my best, I acknowledge the weakness we have as human beings.

#### 📚 Transcript

he's concerned that the world is going to fall apart, all he sees is confirmation of his viewpoint. That's why he won't move back to the city to keep his marriage together because for him to do so would have would mean to admit that he was wrong and he won't do it. And so all he sees is none stop ever continuing confirmation of his viewpoint. He won't see anything else because as human beings, we don't believe what we see. We see what we believe. We all do. And so we need to be really thoughtful and careful about forming our beliefs because we're going to see what we believe. We're not going to believe what we see. It's a very unusual personality and or skill that allows someone to disassociate himself from his beliefs and study something factually. I believe it's something that we can develop in ourselves. I would like to think that I've done that to some degree. I don't want to fool myself because of course, maybe I just am seeing what I believe. I believe that about myself and so therefore I see it. But I do my very best. And that's all one of us can do is try to account for this weakness that we have as human human beings.

###  [Finding Peace and Identity by Leaving the United States](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3854329e-c832-449f-bcfa-4ffb9dc2cb9e) 

🎧 48:49 - 50:08 (01:19)

Andrew Henderson, the Nomad capitalist, left the United States because he never felt comfortable being an American. He found peace and a sense of identity by leaving his home country. It's wonderful when individuals who don't fit in their home culture or country find belonging elsewhere. Some of the best Americans are those who have left their country and embrace what the United States offers. However, this was not the author's experience as they strongly identify as culturally American and appreciate their country.

#### 📚 Transcript

I've mentioned, I don't think I've said it to him, but I've mentioned this in the context of Andrew Henderson, the Nomad capitalist. I think one of the best reasons that Andrew left the United States, and he said this publicly, I've just listened to enough of his stuff to hear it clearly, is that he never felt comfortable as an American. One of the great things for him was that he has found much greater peace in his life and in his persona and his culture by leaving the United States and not being an American. I think that's fantastic. If you don't fit in your home culture, in your home country, then you should leave. Some of the best Americans that I have met, the people who most thoroughly embody the American spirit and American values, etc, are those who have left their country and come to the United States because of what it offers them. They do not identify with their home culture and their home country. They have nostalgia over it, but they don't want to be part of it. I think that's one of the best reasons to leave a country, but that was not my personal experience. I'm very thoroughly culturally American. Regardless of my US citizenship, I'm very thoroughly culturally American. I appreciate the United States so much, and I'll never be anything else.
