###  [The Power of Small Daily Improvements in Work and Business](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c129605f-f88c-4c73-b754-762f463bfcbc) 

🎧 03:37 - 05:02 (01:24)

Consistently improving your skills and productivity by just 1 tenth of 1 percent per day can lead to significant long-term success. This translates to a 26 percent improvement per month and a remarkable 1,000 percent improvement over a decade. By continuously enhancing your work abilities, you become more effective and increase your chances of earning higher income. While it's not automatic or linear, the compounding effect of consistent improvement can greatly impact your career and business.

#### 📚 Transcript

in your work and in your business today, if you wanted to. And I think that that can be repeated over time. Well, if you do the math 1 10th of 1% improvement per day, leads to 1 half of 1% improvement per week. Over time, that makes about a 2% improvement per month. And winds up being about a 26% improvement over the year if we use 4 week months. And that's about 1,000% improvement in the course of a decade, knowing how these things compound. Don't get too bogged down on the specific numbers. The idea is that 1 10th of 1% per day, repeated over a 5 day work week, consistently, over the years, allows you to be about 1,000% more productive. More effective in your work life. Now, if you wind up being more effective, more productive, then in a capitalist system, in the fullness of time, your own personal effectiveness will be recognized by higher income. And so I think that if you're 1,000% better at your job and at your income, then there's a good chance

that you'll

be able to come back to your business. You'll demand a 10 times higher wage, 1,000% higher wage. It's not automatic, it's not linear.

###  [The Importance of Reading and Synthesizing Books in Academic Pursuits](https://share.snipd.com/snip/51276f1d-b9a3-4944-9acd-ae32bff75723) 

🎧 06:21 - 07:51 (01:30)

Academic degrees often require reading and synthesizing numerous books and writing a dissertation. This process provides equivalent knowledge to a master's or doctoral degree each year. It's essential to have a diverse reading list aligned with your goals and field. Include books related to your profession, but also explore other areas of interest. Don't stick to light reading; focus on studying comprehensive and fundamental texts in your industry.

#### 📚 Transcript

If you go and you look at the world of academia, a formal advanced degree, a doctoral degree, a master's degree, etc., will often require you to read and absorb and synthesize something around 30 to 50 books and then write a dissertation on those books. So if you do this per year, you're getting the equivalent of about a master's degree or a doctoral degree of information, training, etc., in your field every single year. Now, I think that you should have a deeper strategy, which I won't go into here, but the basic idea behind what you choose to read is that you should read in your field and read towards your goals. So read anything that you want, but I think there should be a good variety in your reading materials. You want to choose books that are going to move you in the direction that you want to go in life. This does not have to all be how to become a better manager, but if you are a manager, it should include some books on how to become a better manager. But it should also include books on other areas of goals that you have or directions that you want to take yourself. Do not keep all of your reading light and fluffy. Instead, focus on learning the real meat of your industry. Study the textbooks, study the formal textbooks, the deep level content, the fundamental texts that are available in your field.

###  [Utilizing Your Local Library and YouTube for Free Learning](https://share.snipd.com/snip/74c65ba4-000d-4133-aed0-21e2a59ddd4b) 

🎧 15:53 - 17:08 (01:15)

Local libraries now offer audio book services like Hoopla where you can listen to audio books for free. YouTube is a great option for learning with its vast range of videos, but it can be time-consuming and lacks a quality filter. However, vetted resources are trustworthy but may not provide the most current information, so using both is recommended.

#### 📚 Transcript

So if you have a local library card, a lot of times most local libraries now have some kind of audio book service, Hoopla, there are others as well, but Hoopla seems to be the leading one at the moment, where now you can listen to audio books for free based on your library subscription. It's a really great option. Next, I really love YouTube University. And by that, I just mean going to YouTube and looking for videos on things. I think that a YouTube premium subscription that allows you to skip all advertisements and to download videos so that they're always available is one of the best, some of the best money that you can make. YouTube is fantastic because of its cutting edge nature. You can often get some of the most current insights into a field, get involved with some of the current debates, current best practices, etc. Downside of YouTube is it can be time consuming and hard to filter for quality. There's not a really great quality filter. And this is again why I think that something that has been vetted by trusted editors is of higher priority. But because that vetting process is so time consuming, you often don't get cutting edge information, so they should go together.

###  [The Benefits of Consuming College Lectures for Comprehensive Learning](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ca3ff2be-1a90-46d6-975e-411386fa6148) 

🎧 17:56 - 19:13 (01:17)

Attending college lectures helps ensure your learning is well-rounded and not solely influenced by a favorite book or author. College teachers, experts in their field, strive to cover all aspects of the course content. This broadens your education and complements your self-chosen materials. While self-directed learning is powerful, it's beneficial to engage in formal courses and credentialization. The business world may not immediately recognize self-directed learning, so a balanced approach is encouraged.

#### 📚 Transcript

And so going and consuming college lectures and consuming all of the college lectures for courses will help you to make sure that your learning is not unduly influenced by the one book you found that you really liked or the author that you latched on to. But rather that you understand what is taught at the college level. And college teachers are by virtue of their screening process. They are experts in their domain. And they have a duty to their students to represent all of the different aspects of their particular course content. And so it's a really great way of making sure that your knowledge is compendious and that you yourself have a broad education that complements your deep education in the self chosen materials. So those are all things that are available to you to listen to in your car. I would encourage you also to make certain that not all of your learning is auto didactic. Consider engaging in formalized courses and credentialization in your field. While self directed learning is the most powerful form of learning because if your engagement with it, self directed learning is not always recognized immediately in the business world.

###  [The Benefits of Attending Conferences for Networking and Industry Insights](https://share.snipd.com/snip/71cb8e15-e9af-4e95-a08d-efd2b5c4ef34) 

🎧 22:20 - 23:41 (01:20)

Conferences offer a concentrated exposure to activities in your field. They provide opportunities to meet important figures, gather cutting-edge ideas, and gain a broad overview of your work. They also offer access to an expo hall where you can connect with industry companies and vendors. Conferences are a valuable platform to make connections, build friendships, and explore new opportunities.

#### 📚 Transcript

And so I actively avoid being away very much. Of course, today we can do online conferences, which are a great option. But the point of a conference is that you can have in one single conference a very concentrated exposure to all of the activity in your field. You can not only meet the movers and shakers, not only harvest the current cutting edge ideas, but get a broad overview of your work. You have the topics that are of interest. I love to take a brochure from a conference and read through the titles for the talks and the presentations. And that'll give me an idea of what are the current areas of focus for this particular industry or this particular movement. You also, of course, have access to an expo hall. You can go and you can find out who all the companies are and the vendors that are involved in your industry. And these things are the threads that you can pull on to start to push yourself in the direction of new opportunities. Conferences are wonderful ways for you to make connections with people, to start to build friendships. They are the best way for you to dig your well of friendships before you're thirsty. You always want to dig your well before you're thirsty. And you want to dig your well of contacts and connections

###  [How to Make the Most of Conferences](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4671207c-d1fb-4caf-a2c9-4accc3933da3) 

🎧 24:41 - 26:08 (01:27)

To make good use of conferences, it's important to connect with the people involved. Take the conference brochure and write down the speakers' names, connect with them. Also, familiarize yourself with their companies and connect with vendors in the industry. This will provide you with a connection roadmap for opportunities. Additionally, learn public speaking skills through organizations like Toastmasters International. Conferences will then become vital for gaining exposure for yourself and your ideas.

#### 📚 Transcript

And so making good use of them is really important. I want to give you just a hint, though. One of the best things that you can do at a conference is use it as a way to gain access to all of the people who were involved in that conference. And so your best friend in making good use of conferences is for you to take the brochure and systematically write down the speakers of the conference, their names, connect with them in some format, write down the companies that those speakers work for, get familiar with their work, and then go through the vendor list and be connected with all the people who are supplying that industry. And if you do that and you start systematically making connections at a conference, all you need is one conference to give you your connection roadmap, which can be in a tremendous roadmap for your opportunities. Now, another thing that I urge people to do is to learn how to be an effective public speaker. I really love still to recommend Toastmasters International as the single best, most available organization for you to practice and polish both your public speaking skills and your leadership skills in a structured, safe, risk-free environment. And if you do that, then conferences will ultimately become one of the most important ways for you to gain exposure for yourself and your ideas.
