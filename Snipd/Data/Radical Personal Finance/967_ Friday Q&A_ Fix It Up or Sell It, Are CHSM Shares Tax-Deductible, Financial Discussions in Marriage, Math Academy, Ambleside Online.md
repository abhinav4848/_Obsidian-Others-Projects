###  [The Importance of Learning Science and Interleaved Learning](https://share.snipd.com/snip/72e7a15c-6715-4393-bfe9-352e1494e7f9) 

🎧 56:56 - 58:29 (01:33)

The speaker shares their interest in learning science and exposes the misconception that we are never taught how to learn. They explain how interleaved learning is superior to blocked learning based on various studies and experiences. Contrary to popular belief, drilling is not the most effective learning method.

#### 📚 Transcript

I have also, let me go first at math academy actually. So then listener told me about math academy. And over the last couple years, I've done a deep dive on learning science. I've been super interested in cognitive science neuroscience trying to understand what we know about learning. It's really amazing. Because I was never taught how to learn. You were never taught how to learn. None of us were ever taught how to learn. And what's interesting is that we all know how to learn. But the things that we think we know about it are generally not so not true. So not true. And so I've dug into a little bit and I now apply a lot of my own understanding of some of these learning techniques to the brilliance of things like John Saxon. So for example, we know from laboratory exercises that human beings do much better with interleaved learning than with block learning. We know that proven in physical endeavors, there's exercises that have been done with badminton players and tennis players, etc. We know this in all kinds of academics spaces. I'm not aware of any space where interleaved learning is not superior to blocked learning. When measured by long term retention, sometimes blocked learning gives a an immediate response that is higher than interleaved learning. But when you insert a little bit of time of decay of learning, so a week or a couple of weeks or something like that, and you come back interleaved learning is universally superior. So the idea is we naturally think that the way to learn something is well, let's just drill, drill, drill, drill.

###  ["Life of Fred" Math Curriculum: A Unique Approach to Education](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4cb3a361-02ee-49cb-a7b7-cc5d981a13a5) 

🎧 01:01:45 - 01:03:10 (01:25)

Discovering the Life of Fred curriculum was a game-changer for me. Accidentally stumbling upon it while researching finance curricula, I was blown away by the concepts included. Stanley Schmidt, the creator, uses an absurd story about a one-year-old math teacher named Fred who lives at a college called Kittens. Despite the ridiculousness, my children love it and I appreciate the focus on narrative and context, rather than just problems and instructions.

#### 📚 Transcript

It's just all problems and instruction. And I don't necessarily fault them for that. In fact, I don't think I don't see how the creators could do anything else. They're creating the curriculum as part of their government school efforts, etc. And so I'm happy to do it. And I don't really care whether my children are doing math. And it says how much are the pencils that Johnny bought for his Bible study versus how much are the pencils that Johnny bought. I don't care about all the little Christiany thing. I care about the quality of the education, but I do care deeply about the narrative. I do care deeply about the context. So that brings me now to life of Fred. I have become an enormous fan of life of Fred. I found life of Fred accidentally a couple years ago when I was researching personal finance curricula for students. And I was trying to see if something was out there and I stumbled across the preview for the life of Fred personal finance book. And I read the table of contents and I was blown away at the concepts that he included Schmidt, I think Stanley Schmidt included in the life of Fred finance books. And so then I started looking at his math curriculum. And then I started to get it and I bought it and I started testing it. And my children love it. And basically what Stanley, again, I think it's name is Schmidt Stanley something or other. What Stanley has done is that he took this, he uses an utterly ridiculous story. I mean, Fred for the context, he starts off as one year old math teacher who lives at a college called kittens university.

###  [The influence of Charlotte Mason in education](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cf577f83-41e9-48ef-8c9f-18d24e0be5d6) 

🎧 01:13:37 - 01:14:57 (01:19)

Charlotte Mason was an extraordinary educator who was ahead of her time. Although I haven't deeply explored other educators like John Steiner, Rudolph Steiner, and Maria Montessori, I find Charlotte Mason's approach to be exceptional. I appreciate the Montessori and Waldorf movements for their positive impact on children. However, I am continually impressed by Charlotte Mason and her teaching methods, especially as I learn more about the process of learning. Ambleside online is just one example of the many excellent curriculum options available based on Charlotte Mason's principles.

#### 📚 Transcript

And in all of my studies of educational philosophy, educational outcomes, etc, I continue to be amazed at how prescient and far ahead of her time Charlotte Mason was. I cannot point to a single educator that I think is better than her. To be fair, I have not done a deep dive on all of the educators who are in her class. I have not done a deep dive on John Steiner, John Steiner, Steiner, Rudolph, excuse me, I'm blanking on the name basically, Waldorf by education. I have not done a deep dive on Maria Montessori, etc. But I have done a deep dive on Charlotte Mason. So I may be ignorant about some of those things and I'm not criticizing any of those other approaches. I think that for many people, I'm so grateful for the broad growth of the Montessori movement. I think that's fantastic. So many children are being saved from the terrors of industrial schooling by those wonderful Montessori schools. Waldorf, wonderful, like I've got nothing bad to say about it. But I'm particularly impressed by Charlotte Mason. And I continue to be particularly impressed by her the more that I myself learn about learning. And so Ambleside online is one of several. There's many other good curriculum Charlotte Mason.

###  [The Power of Narration and Higher Order Learning in Homeschooling](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a2dc6acd-6908-4939-a415-eef53b42afd7) 

🎧 01:19:35 - 01:20:59 (01:24)

Taking effective notes involves focusing on concepts that are not understood or require connections. Narration is a powerful tool for higher order learning as it encourages discussing connections. Ambleside Online is a comprehensive resource for homeschooling that should be the starting point. It may take time to fully incorporate it, as initially, we selectively followed the program. However, with practice, we improved in areas such as nature study and recitation.

#### 📚 Transcript

The only thing you should take notes on are things that you either don't understand that you need to go back and connect to or notes that are connecting ideas in some way that's unique where you're rearticulating it. But the narration is beautifully viewed as a form of free recall, free recall, where you are articulating something. And then in the context of narration, what I think is really powerful about it is we're doing higher order learning. We're not just spitting out facts, but we're talking about connections, which is the best encoding strategy and way you do higher order learning. So Ambleside Online is just a wonderful resource with world-class books and a world-class setup that is comprehensive in nature. And I think it should be the starting place for everybody. Now, it took us years of practice to become better at fully incorporating it. When we were just getting started as homeschoolers, we basically just picked and chose. That's a funny, that's a funny grammatical. We picked and chose, we picked and chose, I guess. So we said, okay, we can do the readings. And so we would do the readings, but we didn't do all of the so-called free readings. Then we got better over time. We kind of did a little nature study, but we weren't so great with it. We're still okay with nature study, not as good as I'd like to be. We've gotten a lot better at that recitation. We've incorporated everything. Like, we're doing a lot better, but it's taken us years to improve. And so what I would say is, just pick and choose.

###  [Comparing Children's Cognitive Ability and the Benefits of a Charlotte Mason Education](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6b5e8f2c-b0d4-46a1-8027-beff2ae17012) 

🎧 01:22:10 - 01:23:35 (01:24)

Comparing my children's cognitive ability to others is a challenge, but I know they've inherited intelligence from my wife and I. I refuse to do traditional testing, but I've seen their capabilities as they grow. In our homeschool curriculum, we study Shakespeare and read advanced texts together. We never dumb things down for children, but make it accessible to them. A teacher visiting my house was amazed by the books appropriate for each grade level.

#### 📚 Transcript

I don't know how to compare my children's natural cognitive ability to other children. Just be warned that my wife and I are not stupid. I'm sure they've inherited a decent level of cognitive ability from us, but I don't know how to compare that to other children. I have no context for that, and I refuse to do any kind of testing, or IQ testing, and things like that. What I have watched is, and I have more confidence today, as I watch now my younger children coming through, and I can see, okay, it's not just a fluke with my eldest, but my children are capable of things. By the way, this is common. You spend some time in the Ambleside Online forums and talking to people, and you'll find that this is common. We do, starting in third grade, basically year three, we do complete full Shakespeare. In the first few years, we do some retellings and whatnot to make it simpler, but we do Shakespeare as a standard part of it. My children find it hilarious. They love the... They would be sitting there reading, listening. I put an audio book along with the text, and just cracking up in the other room with Shakespeare. We read Plutarch. We read all this stuff together, and we get huge value out of it. That's one of the beautiful things about a Charlotte Mason education, is that you never dumb stuff down for children. What you do is you make it accessible to them. The other day, I had a teacher who was visiting my house. Somebody was a trained teacher, classroom teacher, was getting ready to start a school. I was going through my library and just showing, and I was handing it. I was like, look, this is the first grade book, this is the second grade book, basically.

###  [The Importance of Language Acquisition and Practical Skills in Childhood](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3451c852-8aad-47e3-bf69-51348f7f1b9b) 

🎧 01:26:52 - 01:28:15 (01:22)

We're making progress in learning biblical Greek using biblingo as a primary resource. We're also studying Chinese through an app-based approach using Hello Chinese. We plan to add more languages in the future. I believe that learning languages is most effective before the age of 10, as the opportunity cost increases with age. Practical skills like coding and video editing become more valuable as kids get older.

#### 📚 Transcript

And we're just working on it as well, as you know, working through the the Vulgate New Testament and whatnot now with good understanding. I've introduced biblical Greek, and we're making progress in that. I'm using biblingo as a primary resource for that. What the work they're doing is fantastic. And then supplementing that with Athenezae. We're just getting started with that. We're doing Chinese, primarily using an app-based approach, using Hello Chinese. And then we're getting ready to start on some workbooks, etc. And then we'll go ahead and add in some other languages as well. So I've got four good academic languages of English, Spanish, French, and German, and then the ancient languages of Latin and Greek, and I'll introduce Hebrew as well in the future. And we're getting a we're a good start. And so I believe that kind of prior to age 10, the brain is really beautifully prepared for language acquisition, and there's very low opportunity cost. When you get to after say 10, 12, 14, I think the opportunity cost for languages gets higher. So you know, is it more valuable to study Chinese or to learn how to code computers? I think probably coding computers is more important than Chinese. But yet not at eight. So maybe at 14 though, definitely coding is better, or the opportunity cost of practical skills. So learning to edit video, I think is a really good use of time for a 14 year old.

###  [Learning Science through Biographies: A Different Perspective](https://share.snipd.com/snip/86ccdeb8-62e4-4c61-a49d-f7af3ac5703e) 

🎧 01:31:14 - 01:32:37 (01:22)

Scientists are not all-knowing, and learning science through biographies allows for a deeper connection. The author read Eve Curie's biography of Marie Curie alongside their eldest child and was amazed at how it beautifully intertwined the personal story with the scientific discoveries. They suggest exposing children to more biographies before formal science studies to spark interest. While textbooks are valuable, the author believes they are not suitable for young children.

#### 📚 Transcript

And they think that scientists just, you know, are this royal cast that knows everything. And so I really love the idea of of learning a lot of science from biographies by walking with the scientists. I my my eldest read Eve Curie's biography of her mother Marie Curie this last year. I read about half of it allowed. He got about halfway through and then he got bogged down. So I read about the other half allowed to him. And I was just amazed at how beautiful it was to just walk alongside with Marie and Pierre through every stage of their life. And yet how deeply you're able to learn about radioactivity and the process of discovering radioactivity and seeing work out and how deeply it connects when you do it in the form of a biography where you care about the people. And so I really, really want to see children exposed to more biographies at a young age that that at a young age as a precursor to their formalized science studies. I really do believe in the value of textbooks and connections that are made through textbooks and the clear laying out of the current knowledge base of a subject. I'm not anti textbook, but I'm definitely anti textbook for young children.

###  [The Value of Biographies in Early Science Education](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b6abad3f-007d-4bd8-aa69-d6b427d27098) 

🎧 01:32:08 - 01:33:25 (01:17)

Children should be exposed to more biographies as a precursor to their science studies. Textbooks are valuable, but not for young kids. By engaging with biographies, children can develop a connection and care for the subject. It's not about how much they know, but how much they care.

#### 📚 Transcript

And so I really, really want to see children exposed to more biographies at a young age that that at a young age as a precursor to their formalized science studies. I really do believe in the value of textbooks and connections that are made through textbooks and the clear laying out of the current knowledge base of a subject. I'm not anti textbook, but I'm definitely anti textbook for young children. And if children can come into the textbook having a long connection, right, this we're reading about going to read a biography of Robert Boyle, this next term. And I'm so excited about that because here is the key to understanding chemistry and caring about chemistry. One of my favorite Charlotte Mason quotes is that is this and it's relevant to the question of how do you know a child is well educated. Her quote is something like this. It's not how much a child knows that matters. It's how much does a child care. And I really believe that there's wisdom there that we need to implement. It's not how much a child knows we're living in an era in which any fact can be spat out of an electronic device. What matters is how much does a child care.

###  [The Importance of Balancing Academic Work and Free Time in Homeschooling](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4beb38f1-47bb-4a7a-9aa2-5323728ce9c2) 

🎧 01:36:36 - 01:38:06 (01:29)

A homeschooling parent emphasizes the importance of play and free time for children while also dedicating about five hours a day to academic work. They mention that strong readers can complete a curriculum in two to three hours. Their philosophy on testing has changed, as they now recognize the value of testing based on the research of Robert Bjork, a respected learning scientist from UCLA.

#### 📚 Transcript

For context, I shoot right now for my older two, 10 year old and eight year old, I shoot for about five hours of daily academic work and I'll often give them a break and drop it to less. So that's probably more than a lot of homeschoolers will do. But I think it's not unreasonable. I really believe in the value of just play. I really believe in the importance of free time undirected, you know, free time for children. But I try to do basically plan on formalized academics nine to noon and then one to three. So it winds up being about five hours. And again, I'll often cut the afternoon short if necessary or because because we can do in five hours, you can do enormous amounts. I would guess that for us at this stage, we could do Ambleside online, the entire curriculum in about two to three hours a day. But I do have strong readers. And so that's something that we've worked hard at and and built to over the year. There are two things that I'm, I know my philosophy has changed on over the last year. I'll share those two things specifically. Number one is the value of testing. I have tried. So I used to be very anti test. I didn't see the point of tests. Then I learned about Robert Bjork's research on testing. And I have been persuaded that he is correct. So I am now trying to incorporate more testing into my children's learning process. Robert Bjork, UCLA, learning scientist, one of the better leaders from an academic perspective in this field.

###  [Testing as a Learning Opportunity: Insights from Learning Scientist Robert Bjork](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1a4cd1a5-eede-4a37-a042-36474bfe6cef) 

🎧 01:37:47 - 01:39:10 (01:22)

Robert Bjork, a learning scientist from UCLA, has persuaded me to incorporate more testing into my children's learning process. Interesting research shows that those who are tested three times after one study session perform better than those who study three times and then have a test session. Additionally, those who study, test, test, test and then take a break for a couple of weeks perform vastly better than those who study, study, study.

#### 📚 Transcript

And I have been persuaded that he is correct. So I am now trying to incorporate more testing into my children's learning process. Robert Bjork, UCLA, learning scientist, one of the better leaders from an academic perspective in this field. Basically, he persuaded me that teachers should use testing as a learning opportunity. There's interesting research that's done. Let's say you have three sessions that session and you have two groups. Group one has a certain amount of material to study and you study study study and session one, and then session two you study, study, study, and then a session three you study, study study and then a session four your tested, and then group two has session one where you study. And then in session two you're tested, then in session three you're tested and then in session four you're tested. What is interesting about those is that those who are tested three times after one study session do better than those who study three times and then have a test session. And there's a little, I think they do, I'm pretty sure they do better immediately. But what's really interesting is if you then insert a couple of weeks into it, and then you come back that those who were just study, test, test, test do vastly better than those who study, study, study.

###  [Resolving the Distinctions Between Classical Education and Charlotte Mason](https://share.snipd.com/snip/939bf65b-f14b-4cfe-90c1-4414d7d3293c) 

🎧 01:40:32 - 01:41:56 (01:23)

There are differences between classical education and Charlotte Mason, but I have resolved the conflicts. Classical education is on the rise and I'm grateful for that. Many people have a narrow view of classical education based on Dorothy Sayers' speech, but that does not define it. Sayers herself brought a unique interpretation to the ideas of grammar, logic, and rhetoric.

#### 📚 Transcript

I have now fully resolved all of the distinctions between these. And I do not believe that there is any fundamental disconnect between classical education and Charlotte Mason. Classical education is on a huge rise and I'm grateful to see that. There are differences between the focus of classical education. Let me articulate these for a moment and how I've resolved the conflicts that I thought were there. First, one of the frustrations that I have with the way that the term classical education is bandied about is that many people seem to have isolated their understanding of classical education to a fairly primitive expression of Dorothy Sayers, the lost tools of learning, speech. I have nothing against Sayers. I think that the lost tools of learning is a really great speech. I recorded and released it years ago in the annals of radical personal finance. You can listen to my recording of her speech. I think it's a useful discussion. But Dorothy Sayers lost tools of learning does not define classical education. Sayers herself in that speech brought a novel interpretation of the ideas of grammar logic and rhetoric and applied them to develop mental stages in a student's life.
