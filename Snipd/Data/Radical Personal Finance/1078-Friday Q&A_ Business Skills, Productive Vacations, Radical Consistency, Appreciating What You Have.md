###  [Achieving Goals and New Problems](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ca9130c2-94cf-4f17-9176-4c6b1d138dd0) 

🎧 45:03 - 46:07 (01:03)

- Achieving goals doesn't magically make life easy.
- Each accomplished goal brings its own set of new challenges and problems.

#### 💬 Quote

> Every goal that you achieve brings on a new set of problems.
> — Joshua Sheets

Joshua Sheets on the nature of achieving goals.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Joshua Sheets:** My pleasure. And I think it is a common experience, though. And let me just quickly mention what I think that means. It's not that having more money is not better. I think most people who've been rich and who've been poor would acknowledge that being rich is better. It's not that being a billionaire is not better than being broke. But what I think we do as humans is we are so fixated on accomplishing the goal that we've tried to set that we think that somehow when I get to this goal, everything is just going to be easy and fantastic for me. And that is not the case, is that every goal that you achieve brings on a new set of problems. And in fact, I just saved this morning to my photo roll a little cute little picture of it's a mom, it's a bear mom, some mouse mom or something, a nice little piece of art. And she's feeding all of her children, her little mouse children around a table. And the quote is, silly me, here I was hurrying through all the things I once hoped for.

###  [Life Doesn't Get Easier](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f4f14b49-c298-47f3-841a-eefe4146e67a) 

🎧 47:25 - 48:20 (00:54)

- People often strive for goals thinking life will be easy once they're reached.
-  However, each accomplishment brings new challenges; it doesn't get easier, but you are rewarded with the opportunity to face the next challenge.

#### 💬 Quote

> You overcome each challenge, and your reward is that you get to be here tomorrow for the next one.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Joshua Sheets:** And I think also one other comment I would make on this, just speaking generally. We often have this idea, this mindset, that the reason to accomplish something is to—the reason we accomplish something is so that life will be easy. And the other thing that I saved this morning in my notes, I have a collected file where I save collected wisdom, wisdom I come across so I can refer to it. This was a quote from Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar. He was being interviewed, and I read the transcript of what was being shared. And he was asked, what has been your biggest lesson? And here's the CTO of big company Palantir. And he says, it doesn't get easier. You overcome each challenge, and your reward is that you get to be here tomorrow for the next one.

###  [Tax Savings vs. Great Life](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ad738f4c-34d9-4813-a662-c4b0a7551240) 

🎧 54:29 - 54:51 (00:22)

- Joshua Sheets used to prioritize tax savings but realized it led to regrets.
- A great life, not a tax-free life, is the ultimate goal.

#### 💬 Quote

> Basically every time I've ever made tax savings the key thing, I've always regretted it. Living a tax-free life is not the goal. Living a great life is the goal.
> — Joshua Sheets

Joshua Sheets on prioritizing a fulfilling life over tax optimization.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Joshua Sheets:** And then I moderated on my views towards tax savings. And I realized that basically every time I've ever made tax savings the key thing, I've always regretted it. And living a tax-free life is not the goal. Living a great life is the goal. And I say the same thing with regard to investments, that having
