## Snips

###  [Quality of Ideas vs. Production Value](https://share.snipd.com/snip/150f23b4-9aa8-45cd-82c7-978a5d8ab740) 

🎧 40:58 - 42:24 (01:25)

The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding different perspectives in financial matters and realizing that advice is often not in conflict but varies based on individual circumstances. They stress the straightforward nature of most financial issues and the importance of considering individual conditions to determine the correct course of action. The speaker expresses satisfaction with the quality of their course content but acknowledges the challenge of keeping up with high production values. They highlight the trend of enhancing production around ideas, making it difficult for idea-driven individuals to match that level, emphasizing the need to strike a balance between quality of ideas and production value.

#### 📚 Transcript

I'm able to do that by using things like a lens of scale or understanding what matters now. And this is why so much and helping people understand where is advice actually in conflict and where are you just perceiving advice to be in conflict. And most financial issues, especially, really are fairly straightforward. And if somebody understands both sides of an argument or eight sides of an argument, you can see how it's the individual conditions of the person that ultimately determine which of these eight arguments is the correct argument. And to me, that stuff just falls in place pretty easily and logically, et cetera. And so I've tried to do that with my courses and I'm pretty satisfied with most of them. But some of them on the market, it's pulled some of them off, gone back and forth. But I'm satisfied with the quality of the content. I was never been really satisfied with the quality of production. What is the things that's happened in the world of ideas is simply we have created more beautiful production around ideas and that has made it harder for idea people to match that level of production. There's a real balance here because

###  [Recognizing Emerging Trends](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7e1302dc-bb52-4045-b8b9-53671414e341) 

🎧 01:25:25 - 01:26:48 (01:23)

Observing the rise of Andrew and his content, the speaker recognized the value in his ideas and sought an interview due to their ability to identify trends accurately. While Andrew's shock value persona attracted attention, the speaker found some of his background distasteful.

#### 📚 Transcript

And so I try to keep my proverbial fingers in the stream of culture and understand what's happening. And I saw Andrew and his content coming to the fore. And I followed him closely because Andrew has some he's incredibly smart man and incredibly well spoken. He has honed his craft very, very diligently. And a lot of his ideas are very, very useful. And a lot of them are very appealing. So I saw him coming up and I asked for an interview and he said, yes. And I did it because I I've I've learned now long enough. I've recognized that I'm not bad at seeing trends. I can see trends happening and I can predict with some some degree of confidence where they're going. I haven't been able to figure out how to apply this to financial markets, but I can see this with social trends, at least to some degree. And so I knew Andrew was getting ready to blow up. So I was clout chasing a little bit, asked him for an interview and his background, his business, his persona. A lot of his public persona is for shock value. He he does it. You know, he has embraced the idea that there's no such thing as bad publicity. But a lot of his background is very distasteful to me.

###  [Judging Character Through Actions](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f8822bb2-1c18-4a78-b310-d57ebcc26e05) 

🎧 01:31:02 - 01:32:23 (01:21)

Legal systems may be flawed, yet evidence points to the speaker's belief that Andrew is a smart but dangerous individual. The speaker detests predators and bullies and is critical of individuals who exploit others. This particular episode was the only one out of a thousand that the speaker deleted, emphasizing the importance of integrity and transparency in sharing content. The speaker's intention is to keep all episodes accessible to showcase growth and improvement over time, highlighting the message that starting imperfectly is crucial to achieving greatness.

#### 📚 Transcript

And even then, you know, legal systems can be messed up. But I think there's enough evidence that there's abundant court evidence to confirm my own assessment that Andrew is a very smart and well-spoken predator. And I don't really like predators. I don't like bullies. I don't like predators. I don't like people who prey on men. And I'm not alleging for those of you who are big and you take fans, I'm not alleging anything that that even based on court documents of his alleged crimes, I'm just talking about things from his own mouth of the way that he made his money. And so as much as I enjoyed the conversation, and as much as I thought it was, I had tried to walk that line, I don't know, that was the one that was the one episode of radical personal finance that I deleted out of a thousand. I've deleted probably I've pulled a few months ago. I pulled a question from a Friday Q&A show because I had answered it poorly. Other than that, I don't remember ever deleting anything else. It's all there. Good, bad, ugly, long-winded, crisp, concise. It's all there for you to see. And that was always my hope. That was always my idea was that and I said this in the very beginning, I'll leave up the early episode so that other people can see that you don't have to be great to start, but you got to start to be great.
