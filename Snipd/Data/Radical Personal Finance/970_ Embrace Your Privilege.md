###  [Intellectual capacity, physical attractiveness, and societal inheritance - Understanding advantages and compassion](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a10736e4-87cb-4367-9a74-c23652230386) 

🎧 08:29 - 09:54 (01:25)

Recognizing someone's intellectual limitations and feeling compassion for them can bring up the question of how to deal with it. Additionally, physical attractiveness can provide numerous advantages in life, such as automatic respect and admiration. The circumstances of one's upbringing, like being raised in a meritocratic society, also greatly impact opportunities and success. We are fortunate to be living in a peaceful and stable society, which is not the norm throughout history.

#### 📚 Transcript

It just doesn't he or she doesn't seem to have the intellectual capacity to do something. And it fills your heart with compassion when you recognize that and you then have to figure out what do I do with it? So, and then things like all the little things we talked about health, but physical attractiveness, physically attractive people have enormous advantages. I never thought much about physical attraction, but I always recognize I'm very tall. Tall men have it easier in life. They're automatically respected. They're automatically looked up to, et cetera. The circumstances that you were raised in, being the inheritor of a system, right? I grew up in the United States of America, one of the most remarkable, free and open societies in the world in which you can pretty much become and do anything that you want to become and do. It's a egalitarian system, or excuse me, a meritocracy, a system that relies upon your ability to work hard and to produce results rather than your connection, your family birth, et cetera. And so that makes an enormous difference. We are the inheritors of all of the work that our forebears have done to create a peaceful and stable society. If you look at the history of the world, the normal condition of humanity is that of peace, assuming it's trying to say the exact opposite.

###  [The Toxicity of Privilege and the Importance of Celebrating Others' Successes](https://share.snipd.com/snip/99eb8b5b-14e9-4a89-9f0b-15bf8ef71d8e) 

🎧 11:22 - 12:48 (01:26)

When someone else succeeds, we should celebrate with them instead of feeling jealous. In a funny example, if a fat person wants to go on a diet, their fat friends might try to sabotage their efforts. It's important to surround ourselves with people who support our goals. The idea of checking privilege can be toxic and make people feel bad about things they can't control. We shouldn't ignore the accomplishments of our ancestors, but we should also recognize that we have a responsibility to use our privilege to help others.

#### 📚 Transcript

When someone else is successful, unless I'm very diligent to train myself to rejoice with those who rejoice and to intentionally celebrate their success, it's so easy to just want that person to do worse. If a fat person is surrounded by his fat friends and he starts to go on a diet, his fat friends will try everything they can to try to get him to eat stuff that is going to make keep him fat. He has to get around different people who are going to build him up. And so check your privilege or the concept of getting rid of privilege or acknowledging it and then limiting your actions because of it is a toxic, completely toxic ideology. It's something that strives to make people feel bad about things that they can't control, things that they didn't do. It's something that tries to cause people to discard all of the things that their forebears worked for and struggled for and developed, et cetera. And so we have to be careful that we can be toxic on both sides. So what's the right solution? I think the right solution is to recognize that to whom much is given, much is required. And the reason that we are fundamentally given benefits in life is so that we can help to spread and expand those benefits.

###  [The Responsibility of Education and Embracing Privilege](https://share.snipd.com/snip/039c2872-4389-4f7f-bc7f-43a7f0a3cdfa) 

🎧 15:01 - 16:27 (01:26)

It is our fundamental responsibility to use education for the benefit of others and embrace privilege. Instead of tearing down the privileged, we should seek to increase opportunities for all.

#### 📚 Transcript

And we have that is your fundamental responsibility, your responsibility to do that. If you are well educated, it is your responsibility to help and use your education for the benefit of others because we are all part of our local communities, our broader community. We are humans. We are brothers and we have to work together. And so the ethic is that we have to embrace privilege and yet use it for its positive ends. privilege is something that we want to see more and more of in the world, not less and less. If we tear those who are privileged down and we try to cut them down to size in any way, shape or form, if there's anything we do that causes someone to feel ashamed of where he's come from or ashamed of who he is and what he's achieved, etc., we are creating the seeds of misery and despair. The proper ethic is to recognize these things, understand where they have come from, understand the benefits and the privileges that we have and then seek to increase them for our children and for our fellow man.

###  [Recognizing and Increasing Benefits for Future Generations](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ebd663b9-c0ae-446e-b128-dd09d7e5e1b2) 

🎧 16:11 - 18:01 (01:49)

Recognize and embrace the advantages and privileges we have, and strive to increase them for our children and others. Just like parents who always want the best for their children, we should strive to provide the best for everyone. Embrace your privilege and be grateful to those who have supported and loved you.

#### 📚 Transcript

The proper ethic is to recognize these things, understand where they have come from, understand the benefits and the privileges that we have and then seek to increase them for our children and for our fellow man. It's really interesting when you think about having children because when people, I don't know a parent of any political or philosophical persuasion that doesn't try to give his or her children the very best life and lifestyle that he or she is capable of providing. I don't know a parent. I've never met a parent. There are, I'm sure there's some out there, but I've never met a parent who hasn't been focused on giving his or her children everything possible, every possible advantage. And that's a really illuminating idea. It shows us that we can accurately identify those advantages that people have and then we can seek to pass them along if we focus on them. And with children, we generally feel more altruistic. We generally feel more willing to provide for them without getting benefit for ourselves. But it ought to be the same thing with anybody around. We should be seeking the best for others continually. There is a term that I myself use that's different than check your privilege. And that term is embrace your privilege. Those who have come before you, those who have been around you, those who have loved you, those who have worked for you.
