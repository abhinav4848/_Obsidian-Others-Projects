###  [The importance of doing work you love and never wanting to retire](https://share.snipd.com/snip/068e83d3-b797-4e2b-aac3-948634c90383) [[Processed]]

Finding a job or business that you love and care about can simplify your financial planning and make retirement unnecessary. It is easier to achieve an excellent lifestyle through meaningful work than to accumulate millions of dollars. The key is to focus on the few things that make the biggest difference, which is the cornerstone of success.

#### 📚 Transcript

if you're working at work that you care about for reasons that are important to you and you don't want to retire then in many cases all of your financial planning becomes simpler and easier. And it's dramatically easier to find and develop a job or a business that you love that provides you with a really excellent lifestyle than it is for many people to accumulate the millions of dollars that most of us need to never work again. And so I'm all about doing an 80 20 analysis on life and going with a few things that are going to make the biggest difference. And I'm convinced that that's a cornerstone idea.

###  [The Stages of Financial Independence: From Dependence to Abundance](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8f7e058a-6b11-405c-825a-26e8463ab9ac) [[Processed]]

🎧 09:49 - 19:43 (09:53)

The stages of financial independence, according to the speaker, start from financial dependence to financial solvency, stability, debt freedom, security, independence, freedom, and abundance.

#### 📚 Transcript

One of your go to pieces and another one of the things that I enjoy from your show is your framework for the stages of financial independence. And I'll save you mentioning that you crib this from Tony Robbins. And anyway, I like the way you say it better than the way he says it and your advice is better than his too. So even if he owns more islands, I'm interested in your ideas. I wonder if you'd walk us through those stages. Yeah,

this came from reading the money book that Tony Robbins wrote after many years of not writing books. He published a book called Money Master the Game. In that book, he was talking about the stages of financial independence. And I was inspired by what he said, but I disagreed with some of it and so I wrote my own. And the basic idea behind developing stages is to break down large goals into more meaningful steps because most of us understand that the way that you accomplish a big challenging goal is by understanding the basic steps and the levels to that goal. And in my experience working as a professional financial advisor, I learned that if I just told someone, Oh, look, you need $4 million and they had $30,000, they would often walk out of my office demotivated and lacking clarity on anything that they needed to do because the goal wasn't tangible. It was far off. It wasn't meaningful to their life. And it was just a number, which is hard for the human brain to grasp. And so I developed these stages to try to give somebody an idea that when you're working towards personal financial independence, it comes at different levels. It's not like you're either dependent or independent. Rather, we're dealing with ranges or percentages of independence. And so I began it with stage zero, which is financial dependence. We all begin our financial lives from a place of financial dependence. My children are totally dependent on me for their living, for their food, for everything. They're totally dependent on me. And this can apply to adults as well. We might be a dependent adult. Perhaps we've suffered some kind of setback, lost a job, went through a health scare of some kind. And we find ourselves depending on other people to provide for us. That's where we begin. So the first goal is to move from stage zero, which is financial dependence, to stage one, which is financial solvency. And I define financial solvency as simply the ability to pay for your living expenses and being current on your debts. One place of dependence that many people find themselves as they find themselves behind on debts unable to make their required payments. And so the first goal is to get current, get current on your debts and to be able to cover your own living expenses. And that's solvency, stage one, financial solvency. Then from financial solvency, we want to move on to financial stability, which is stage two. Financial stability simply means that you have some margin in your finances. And this means you have some savings. This can be as simple as developing a beginning emergency fund. For a young person, perhaps you have an 18 year old son who is leaving the house. Well, if he doesn't have any debts and he's able to get a job to pay his living expenses, he's solvent. He's no longer dependent on you. And if that same son saves $1,000, he's now starting to accumulate some measure of financial stability. If he needs a new tire on his car, it's not going to sink him. He's not going to fall into debt for that. And so that's financial stability. For most of us who are adults, financial stability brings in some larger numbers. But the basic idea is you want to figure out how much of an emergency fund do I want to have? How much savings do I want to have and start to accumulate that? I think there are a number of numbers that are useful. It might be $1,000, might be $10,000, might be three months of expenses or six months of expenses. For some people, maybe a year's worth of expenses. But you want to develop some form of savings so that you are financially stable. That's stage two. Now, the next thing that I talk about, and I put it at stage three, although it may not go at stage three, is debt freedom. The goal that many of us have of living a life free from the encumbrances of debt is a very worthy goal. Because if somebody is debt free, that means they have full control over their future. I'm not arguing that debt may not be a very useful tool at some points in life. But any form of debt commits you to certain actions in the future. And so if you want freedom and independence in your life, being debt free should be on your list of priorities. And so I put it here as stage three. The goal is to be debt free. If somebody has enough money to pay their living expenses, if they're current on all their bills, if they have an emergency fund of let's just say $10,000, and if they don't have any debt, or at least don't have any consumer debt, they may have a mortgage on their house, but they don't have credit card debt, etc. That person is very, very independent. That person has the ability to change almost anything in their life. They can leave one career, retrain and start another career. They can move across the country. They can move from a house that doesn't suit them into a better house that does suit them. If their elderly mother gets sick and they want to go and nurse their elderly mother, they can submit their notice at their work and go and nurse their elderly mother. They have independence. And so independence can be one fairly simply through those basic steps. Now there are four remaining stages. And the next three, stage four, five, and six, are basically variations on a theme. Most of my listeners and clients have a goal of being able to work because they want to, not because they have to. Most of my listeners and clients have a goal of being able to live on the income from their investment portfolio. But there are wide ranges of income that they could live on. If you tell me, Joshua, how much money do you want to retire, I'm probably going to give you a big number that involves extravagant international travel, lots of consumption items, lots of expensive experiences, et cetera. But if you said, Joshua, what's the bare minimum that you would need to retire? Well, there's a big difference in those numbers. I might want to live in a beautiful home on the lake, but I could live in a small trailer in a modest trailer park in Central Florida. I might want to take international vacations every year, but I could take a domestic hiking vacation if I wanted to. So what I did was I broke this into stage four financial security, stage five financial independence, and stage six financial freedom. And I defined these in this way. Stage four financial security means you have enough money coming in from your investment portfolio for you to cover your basic living expenses. For you to cover the rent on your apartment, the mortgage on your house, a food in the pantry, basic utilities, et cetera. If you have enough income coming in from your investment portfolio that covers your basic living expenses, then you have a degree of financial security. If you were disabled and you could never work again the rest of your life, you would be okay. That's what I call stage four financial security. Stage five is financial independence. Financial independence means you can cover your current living expenses based upon the income from your portfolio. Maybe you could live on $3,000 a month if you had to, but you're currently spending $7,000 a month because you do a lot of things that you enjoy doing. And so financial independence means covering your current living expenses. And I use that word independence because that's what most of us think of. I can live at my current lifestyle on the income from my portfolio. But I think there is another level that we want to consider. And I call it stage six financial freedom. Although I could live at my current lifestyle forever, there may very well be some additional things I'd like to do or some other things that I would like to do. Or some additional things I'd like to own. Maybe I'd like to own the lake house and I'd like to go ahead and put a nice ski boat there. And maybe a pontoon boat as well. So we have options. Maybe we're currently going around and spending our summer vacations in a small travel trailer, but I'd like a luxurious motorhome of some kind. And I know that that's going to add another $10,000 a year of operating costs. And so what I find as stage six financial freedom is simply, you lay out all of your personal financial benefits. You're personal spending ambitions, your personal lifestyle goals. And you cover those expenses from your portfolio. And when you do that, you're totally financially free. You could spend more than what you have right now if you wanted to. You could spend more than what you're currently spending. And then stage seven is financial abundance, which I think is simply an expression that if you continue to live the way that you're living as an accumulator of wealth, in the fullness of time, you're going to have more money than you need. You're going to have more money than you want. And many people are going to have more money than they could ever practically spend. And that's what I call stage seven financial abundance, which means I have more money than I could ever spend than I want to spend. So now what do I do with it? Money is no longer a constraining factor. But now we move into the point where I have to say, I'm the steward of this wealth. How do I make sure that this wealth flows to places where it's productive, where it's useful, where it does good in the world. Do I give it to people? What do I do with it? And that's what I term financial abundance, stage seven.

###  [The Importance of Physical Preparedness in Financial Planning](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6e505180-95c7-49d0-9c40-13f6b711cbdd) [[Processed]]

🎧 01:08:46 - 01:09:42 (00:55)

Money is the best form of preparedness and can be converted into almost anything. It is the most marketable commodity in the world and can be used to buy anything you need. However, there may be temporary circumstances where money is not effective in the marketplace.

#### 📚 Transcript

let me make the case for physical preparedness, because I think that this is underrepresented in the field of financial planning. I believe that money is generally the best form of preparedness. I had a friend of mine who coined the term money is an omni tool. He said that money is that thing that can get you almost anything else. And that's true. Money can be converted into almost anything in the world. The definition I like of money is that money is the most marketable commodity in the world. Money is the thing that everybody will accept. And so with money, you can buy almost anything out there that you need. You can convert money into anything in any circumstance in any corner of the world. Unless the marketplace is so messed up that money is not working for now. Now, usually that's a temporary condition.

###  [How to Prepare for a Basic Human Need](https://share.snipd.com/snip/071914c2-136c-4837-848b-0be55e77c0d7) [[Processed]]

🎧 01:09:42 - 01:13:45 (04:02)

The podcast discusses the importance of being prepared for market disruptions using the example of the toilet paper crisis in 2020. It highlights the simplicity of stockpiling essential items and suggests additional strategies like using washable cloths or installing a bidet. The podcast emphasizes the need for thoughtful planning and proactive measures to avoid panic and hardships during crisis situations.

#### 📚 Transcript

if the marketplace is messed up, then money is not working for now. And so let me give a few examples as I answer your question. I think it's very fortunate that we're recording this podcast in the fall of 2020 because if we were recording this in the fall of 2019, people would have been looking at me saying, Joshua, I don't really get it. But I like to refer to the great toilet paper crisis of 2020. And simply say that in the great toilet paper crisis of 2020, we see the perfect example of when money stops working. Now, this is an imperfect example because I don't think there's anybody out there who genuinely went without toilet paper just because the stores were wiped out. If you add a $20 bill and you needed a roll of toilet paper for your household, you could walk up and down your block, knocking on your neighbor's doors and say, I will trade you this $20 bill for a roll of toilet paper. And everybody found somebody who would make that trade with them. However, it's illustrative because we know that the stores were wiped out of toilet paper. This very, very simple basic thing that many people all around the world use on a daily basis. It's the simplest thing possible and except it was unavailable for a significant period of time. And so what you'll see if you think about that is that this was the easiest crisis in the world to avoid through a simple strategy of stockpiling. That any thoughtful person who sits down and confronts the problem and says, you know what? Something could happen that could disrupt this market. Here's this product that we use every day in our household that is a very important, valuable part of life. I need to plan in place for if this product doesn't exist. That would lead someone into a few basic obvious steps. The first obvious step is you set aside a couple extra cases of toilet paper. And if you just made a habit of not only buying one case at a time and then waiting until your case was depleted and then going back to Costco and getting another case, but simply maintaining a spot on your shelf where you put two extra cases of toilet paper, then you weren't freaking out during the great toilet paper crisis of 2020. You knew I've got two cases of toilet paper. That's two months of toilet paper. They'll fix this within two months. The market will provide. And so you're stockpiled, the thing that you needed, and then you weren't worrying when the market was messed up temporarily. And so that's a very simple thing, but it was a genuine point of panic for people. You could go into Costco during the toilet paper crisis and you could see people pull up in a Mercedes Benz wearing a Rolex on their wrist. Clearly well healed. And yet here they are basically tostling with people to try to get the last couple cases of toilet paper. That's pathetic. If you think about it, it's totally pathetic. But a little bit of thoughtful planning could say, I should stockpile this thing that we use. Now, of course, your plan could be more robust. And if I were teaching this course, what I would say, this is a class, I would say, well, let's develop three, you know, three different ways to meet this need. So you would say, the first thing I could do is I could stockpile. And so we need toilet paper. So what we'll do is we'll stockpile extra cases of toilet paper. And I would teach someone how to say, how much time worth of toilet paper do you need? I want three months of toilet paper. You calculate what that is and you stockpile three months of toilet paper. Then we would say, well, I want to protect you. So you need a second way to provide for this need. And so maybe it would be something like washable cloths. So maybe instead of just boiling toilet paper, you buy a large jumbo pack of washable cotton cloths that if necessary, this could be used as toilet paper and then washed afterwards. And maybe the third thing is you install in your house a bidet. And whether that's a built-in appliance that you install or something that you would get out, you know, they sell portable bidet, something like that. You have the ability now to manage this basic human need in three different ways if the market doesn't deliver for you. That's good preparedness plan. That's robust preparedness planning. But the point is that all of those things are easy to do before the fact, but they're hard to do after the fact. And so life continues and things can be much more dire.

###  [The Benefits of Physical and Financial Preparedness](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3f285eee-af96-48c5-94eb-2a8e8767a12d) 

🎧 01:25:41 - 01:27:05 (01:23)

Minimizing exposure and staying at home improves your chances of surviving and thriving during the pandemic, as medical professionals have a better understanding of treatments. Physical and financial preparedness make catastrophic situations non-catastrophic and difficult situations more comfortable. It's important to appreciate the benefits and acknowledge the importance of good planning.

#### 📚 Transcript

I'll come in another day and you can do that. And so when you pull back from being at the very edge of risk, when you minimize your exposure because you don't have to go to Costco with the crowds in the early days of the pandemic, when you're not sure how bad it is, and you can stay at home, you can make everything better. And on almost every level of emergency that can happen, that improves things. So for example, you're better off getting COVID in September of 2020 than you were in March of 2020, because now the medical professionals have a much better understanding of the therapies that are going to help you beat it than they did in March. And so if you could sit home and minimize your exposure for that period of time, you maximize your probability of surviving the disease and of thriving during the disease because of that buffer. So I don't want to go on with example after example, I just want to emphasize that these things work harmoniously together that physical preparedness and financial preparedness make otherwise catastrophic situations. Non catastrophic, and they make difficult situations more comfortable. And although we often feel a little bit of guilt guilty to say what you said, Matt, I say the same thing that hey, it hasn't been that bad. I think it's important to say it with appreciation for the benefits that we have, but it's also due to good planning.

###  [Creating Focused Courses and Building High Quality Education](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0f5b356d-c63d-478c-bd5d-e29b8bcf4b82) 

🎧 01:29:25 - 01:30:44 (01:19)

The speaker plans to create more focused courses that answer specific questions and increase exposure through different formats. They want to tailor education to individual needs and provide answers. They reflect on their journey and the importance of goal-setting for achieving success.

#### 📚 Transcript

And so what I need to do is I need to create more focused specific courses that answer people's questions. And so in the beginning, I thought, Oh, I'm going to give it a while away for free. Well, now what I understand is that there's no way for me to give it all away for free because the answers that people are looking for get mired and buried in the sheer volume of audio files to wade through. And so I'm trying to do those. I'm working on doing those two things. Number one is I'm increasing my exposure with more formats to attract people. Number two is I'm building high quality courses that answer specific questions that people have so that the education is tailored to the specific need that they're in at the moment so that they can have answers so those are my projects for 2020 and 2021.

All right, good deal. I wanted to ask you, Joshua, what do you love about where you are today with life work and money.

Years ago I had a dream. I do all these weird goal setting exercises. I would do this dream where I imagined my day, my perfect day. I do this journal exercise where I just think through my perfect day from beginning to end exactly what I would do. You know, I imagine myself lying in my bed and I open my eyes and I look around and I see where am I and what am I do and I go through the whole day. And that perfect day for me had a number of important components.

###  [The Value of Personal Financial Planning and Taking Calculated Risks](https://share.snipd.com/snip/52795e4b-89a6-4e9f-97d7-f58436f76752) [[Processed]]

🎧 01:34:55 - 01:36:10 (01:15)

Starting Radical Personal Finance, I had to go against the advice of my advisors and take risks on my own. This built my confidence and taught me the value of good financial planning to minimize risks. I've learned to never take wipeout risks and feel confident I won't be wiped out. This valuable lesson will continue to pay off in my lifetime.

🔒 Private note: Take risks but first put yourself in a position that you don't suffer a wipeout if your risk goes south

#### 📚 Transcript

When I started Radical Personal Finance, nobody agreed with me. Not that people were disagreeable, but most of my advisors didn't understand. They didn't know what I knew. They didn't understand the marketplace like I thought I understood it. And so I had to take the bet basically on my own, which as a man, I'm incredibly grateful that I did it and I've continued to take bets on my own, do things that other people didn't understand. And as every time I do that, I see the benefits and I see that it builds my confidence and allows me to trust my own judgment more. And so that's been incredibly valuable. Along the way, though, I continue to see the benefits of good financial planning because while you have to take some risks in life, you can dramatically minimize the effects of those risks with good risks with good financial planning. I'm not willing to take a wipeout risk. And so good financial planning allows me to feel confident that it's very unlikely. I won't say impossible, but it's very unlikely that I'll ever be wiped out because I don't take wipeout risks. And to me, that's a very useful and valuable lesson that I have learned early enough in life where I hope it'll continue to pay off throughout my entire lifetime. Awesome.

###  [The Importance of Trying and Failing: Success Comes After Multiple Attempts](https://share.snipd.com/snip/eddade7f-792c-40bc-9460-b2b0003f8fc1) [[Processed]]

🎧 01:38:42 - 01:39:23 (00:41)

Being gentle with ourselves and trying multiple things is important. Many successful people experienced failures before achieving major success. This applies to media brands as well. Trying different approaches and not giving up eventually leads to success. Home runs are not necessary for success, but by continuously trying and putting ourselves in the right position, we increase our chances of finding it.

🔒 Private note: Major success comes after at least 3 failures. So put yourself in a position to take pitches.

#### 📚 Transcript

And I think that it's important to be gentle with ourselves and to be important to be willing to try things, multiple things. I've recently just simply recognized a number of people whose stories where they've had these major successes. But what I have found when I've researched is that the major success came after three other failures. And I've seen this with a number of media brands where they did this, didn't work. They did that, didn't work. Did the other thing didn't work. And then all of a sudden they tried something new and boom, it worked. And so I would point out that you don't need the home run to be successful. But by continuing to try and to put yourself in the position where you can take pitches, there's a better chance that you will be able to find the home run.

###  [Developing the Skill of Weighing Alternative Courses of Action](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ebe41152-e36a-4719-90bf-92cb39975cf7) [[Processed]]

🎧 01:39:36 - 01:42:34 (02:58)

Develop the skill of weighing alternative courses of action, using your ability for abstract thought. In today's world, you can explore your interests through the experiences of others on platforms like YouTube. By exposing yourself to different possibilities, you can imagine the life you want to live. Socrates said an unexamined life is not worth living, and now we have the ability to examine our lives more than ever before. Take advantage of these opportunities, try new things, and live consciously. Dream without limitations and create a plan to move towards your dreams.

#### 📚 Transcript

One great skill that I think all of us can develop is the skill of weighing alternative courses of action. As human beings, we have a faculty that no other creature has, which is abstract thought, the ability to look to the future and to imagine different possibilities. And you can do all of this from your own mind. And in today's world, one major benefit that we have that past generations didn't have is you can, in a way, test drive, things that you're interested in through being exposed to the experiences of others through good quality media. A number of years ago, I took my family on a full time RV trip. We sold our house, we sold all our stuff, we got rid of all our stuff, and we moved into a 30 foot travel trailer. I'm the wacky one in the family, and I was the one who had the idea. My wife had never in her life sat down and thought, well, maybe I want to go and live in a travel trailer. So what I did was I started talking to her about the idea, and then I started finding YouTube channels of people doing it. And I started having her watch YouTube videos of people doing it. Over time, she started to realize, you know, this isn't as crazy as it sounded at first glance. This is possible. This is doable. And eventually we came to the point where we said, yeah, let's do it. And we did it. We had a great time and I'm glad we did it. We'll do it again. I think we'll do it again. Our experience, though, was informed by the example of other people actually doing it. And the same thing occurs in life now. We have access to people's stories. And we have access to people who transform themselves from broke to multi billionaires. And we have access to people who are broken, who stay broke, but who live these really interesting lives, you know, living in a van and the desert for free. And you can access all of them through the palm of your hand, which is just stunning. And so what I encourage people to do is develop broad experience. Expose yourself to what other people are doing and then imagine life in the way that you want it to be because we have the choice in today's world to choose the way that we want to live. And that's awesome. And so you can think carefully about the paths that you might want to pursue. You can think about where you might want to be. And in your head as a human being, you can imagine if I do this, that will point me in that direction. If I do the other thing, I'll point me in another direction. Socrates famously said an unexamined life is not worth living. I don't know if he was right. But if he was right, we have the ability to examine our lives more now than we ever did before. And so as I'm growing older, I'm growing more confident in my willingness to take advantage of these opportunities we have my willingness to try things. And I see the joy that has come to me from that. And I want to encourage other people to do that to live consciously. To think to dream. And to dream without limitation. And then work back to today to where you start to put together a plan that moves you in the direction of your dream.

A former financial advisor encourages the value of working with a good financial counselor in cutting years off the learning curve and maximizing your financial potential.

I look forward to continuing to watch your journey from afar as we continue our own. Joshua, is there anything else that we haven't covered today? We've had a big and far ranging conversation that I really enjoyed. I think the key

thing I'd like to say is as a plug for the work that financial advisors do, I'm no longer a licensed financial advisor. I don't hold any insurance licenses, any investment licenses. I don't really even work with individuals anymore. There's this tremendous challenge that people have when it comes to how to engage with a financial advisor. And obviously that's the work that you're doing now that you've transitioned into when you weren't previously a financial advisor. What I want to point out though, is that a good financial advisor, a good counselor, can cut years and years off of the learning curve that we all have with life. And a good financial advisor who listens to you and who helps you to dream and who thinks about that, and then applies that dreaming and that thinking to the money is an incredibly valuable resource.

In the journey towards financial stability, you move through stages of having enough to cover basic needs, maintaining current lifestyle, enjoying an expanded lifestyle, and eventually having an abundance. Along the way, insurance is crucial but often overlooked. Joshua and I discuss various ways to achieve financial abundance, highlighting the importance of finding work you care about and creating a job or business that supports your desired lifestyle, which is a more achievable solution than relying on saving millions.

In this stage, your investments are sufficient to provide for your minimum living needs. Then in stage five, financial independence, your investments are sufficient to provide your current lifestyle. Stage six, financial freedom. Your investments generate enough income for you that not only can you provide your current lifestyle, you can also provide for an expanded lifestyle, baking some of those dreams in the cake. And then finally, stage seven, financial abundance. You have so much that you just can't even imagine what to do with it all. Your main problem is figuring out how to give it away. Insurance, which is a focus of Joshua and I's conversation, comes into your plan at the start. This is an idea plan at the stage of financial stability. This is an item that needs to be added to your financial planning sooner rather than later. Now, as Joshua and I go on, we talk about other ways that you can create financial abundance in your life. And sort of ask the question, what's easier than retiring with millions and millions of dollars? Well, it turns out it's an awful lot easier to cultivate work you care about for reasons that are important to you and to develop a job for your future. You develop a job or a business you love that provides an excellent lifestyle. This is a much more achievable solution than saving three to six million dollars in order to stop working.
