###  [The Importance of Understanding Blood Glucose](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7f2deb29-4acc-4caa-b684-5a5185ba636a)

This framework is like any other, useful in certain circumstances, but not meaningful at a population level. It's hard to use and not intuitive. The conversations about it mostly involve people who don't have certain health conditions. Overall, it's not very reliable. But let's move on to myth three and talk about rats.

#### 📚 Transcript

So basically, it's like any

other framework, I guess, where it's like maybe useful in certain circumstances. I mean, maybe people use it and like it, and that's fine. But as a sort of population level of recommendation, it just isn't very meaningful.

Yeah, and it's hard to figure out. It's not very intuitive. You have to have these tables with all these

pages and pages of results. And then of course, all that stuff breaks down, too, as soon as you go to a fucking restaurant.

These conversations are mostly happening among people who are not diabetic, don't have PCOS, and don't necessarily have insulin resistance. So they're mostly people as a result who have a very imprecise understanding of blood glucose and how it all works, right?

Like a me. Like a you. Well, you haven't taken me to the rats yet. Myth three is where we get to the rats. Let's do small mammals.

Saving the best for rats. Oh. Oh. All right, that was

actually pretty good. You've topped yourself.
