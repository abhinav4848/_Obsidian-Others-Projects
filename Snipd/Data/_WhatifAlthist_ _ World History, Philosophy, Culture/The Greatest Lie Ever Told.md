Rudyard Lynch on how elites lied about the decline in the quality of life in America.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Rudyard Lynch:** Again, the elites massively lied. I grew up in the Rust Belt. It was an area that used to be the wealthiest place in the world, and then as factories moved to Mexico or China, the region went into rapid decline. Philadelphia has a lower population today than it did in 1950. This was something that was completely obvious to me growing up, since I saw the decay everywhere. The elites said that the free trade was good by definition and would cause progress for everyone. This was an economic position held with religious certainty, where it was a definition from definition. You weren't allowed to question it. However, when the Rust Belt crashed and the quality of life for the average American collapsed precipitously from 1970 onwards, this is what the elite did. Firstly, they said that it wasn't happening. Then they said they would fix it, which they didn't. Then they said you were a bad person for noticing and you should be grateful that you helped progress happen. I have a friend who invented a term I love called pinkerism, or since there are more toilets in Africa, thus progress has happened, and thus the complete collapse of American society is fine. The elites completely lied about the decline in quality of life for the average American until Trump and COVID forced their hand. Bringing up any of these questions at the time would make you socially shamed and outcasted from society. I have still run into lots of very educated people who think that quality of life hasn't declined since the 60s. Then they said anyone who noticed was a bad person. For a very recent example of all of this, let's see how the Biden administration just added nearly a million jobs to the employment stats that never existed.
