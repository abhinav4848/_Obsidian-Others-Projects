#### 📚 Transcript

Well what it is real. You know. That's when you have to start asking yourself those deep philosophical questions. Right. Interesting. There's another case that's. Have you ever seen the movie safe the Todd Haines movie with Julianne Moore? No. It's from like the mid 90s and she played a lady that started to have environmental sickness just in the air and she's got sort of like increasingly crazy as the movie went on as far as scrubbing things and locking herself in her house and making her house a clean environment. That's great. It was good. And there's a true story though of a lady in London named Debbie Bird. She's a health spa manager that says that she's allergic to EMF, electromagnetic fields. And it's an actual thing now. You know there's more than her claiming it's called ES, electromagnetic sensitivity where she has basically transformed her house. She painted it black. She said she's allergic to computers, cell phones, microwaves.
