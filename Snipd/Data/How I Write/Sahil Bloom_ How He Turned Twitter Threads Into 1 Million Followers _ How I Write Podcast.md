## Snips

###  [Embracing Uncertainty and Consensus Thinking](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a8ed78e2-9f50-41b4-bbd5-92ca4d753529) 

🎧 19:35 - 20:36 (01:01)

Embracing uncertainty and being open to unconventional ideas, as exemplified by Peter Thiel, can provide a unique perspective that breaks away from consensus thinking. This willingness to explore unconventional paths and untether curiosity from social expectations can lead to original and groundbreaking creative work, ultimately aiming for others to agree with this unique perspective in the future.

#### 📚 Transcript

**David Perell:** Well, I look at someone like Peter Thiel, who was coming to mind as you were saying that. I Peter is looking in such strange places for ideas, and he's willing to entertain things that most people are not. And look at the eye that that gives him, right? The problem with certainty is that insistence on certainty leads to consensus thinking. And so much of writing is from breaking away from the consensus, whether that's how you write, whether that's the stories that you tell, whether that's the analogies that you pull from. And the compass of curiosity when it's untethered by social expectations can take you to those places. Yeah.

**Sahil Bloom:** There's a famous saying in investing that applies to Peter Thiel, that the goal is for everyone to agree with you later. And it's really true. I think the same applies to some of this creative work. I also am of two minds on this.

###  [Recognizing an Epiphany through Energizing Encounters](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e984122b-622a-48cd-8ea2-aa8de2edae12) 

🎧 24:54 - 25:49 (00:54)

The speaker experiences an epiphany when encountering something that energizes them to the point of wanting to fully immerse themselves in it, even if it initially seemed uninteresting. This feeling of intense energy and the desire to engage further is what defines an epiphany for the speaker.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Sahil Bloom:** I read, listen to, or meet with someone, and I leave that moment wanting to go sprint and run around and go crazy, that's an epiphany for me. When I get so much energy all of a sudden, I had a lunch yesterday with a very successful individual who is so passionate about this one pretty weird esoteric thing that I actually wouldn't say was like the most interesting thing in the world to me going into that lunch. I left literally wanting to go to the ends of the earth, wanting to like understand that more, engage with it more, you know, be a part of it in any way that I could. That to me is an epiphany. Like when you leave so energized that you need to go run on a treadmill to calm yourself down, that's what an epiphany feels like to me. Yeah.

**David Perell:** What about you? Hold

###  [Cultivating Surprise and Creativity in Life](https://share.snipd.com/snip/15eb460c-8f1f-45ae-a7e1-cc696335fe43) 

🎧 30:43 - 32:08 (01:24)

Creating systems in life to cultivate surprise involves consuming a variety of ideas and influences, such as what you read, listen to, and who you spend time with. The key to creativity lies in the middle layer, where ideas are allowed to connect and bounce around in the mind, and where thinking and contemplation take place, separate from external influences.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Sahil Bloom:** a life to generate surprise. It's like creating, I think in systems a lot

**David Perell:** and

**Sahil Bloom:** thinking about how you create systems for surprise. It's an interesting, it's a, it's a paradox, right? It's like a weird thing. It's a weird idea. Like how do you create systems in your life that cultivate surprise? Because I often, with my own writing, I think about, okay, what do I do in order to create those moments? Like the inspiration, if I were to distill it, like there's a huge component that's consuming. You need to open the funnel to tons of interesting ideas at the top end in order to get sparked, in order to have those things intermingle in your mind. So what are you reading? What are you listening to? Who are you spending time What conversations are you having? Who are you inspired by? What are the environments you're in? And then there's that next layer, which is what we're talking about, which is like that middle layer that everyone overlooks. You think, oh, consume, and now I'm going to write. But the middle layer is where the gold is. The middle is the sitting and thinking, or it's the walking and thinking where you're not listening to an audio book on 2x speed. You're not listening to a podcast. You're just sitting there and thinking. And that, I think, like the system for creativity for me is that middle layer. It's the just thinking, allowing ideas to connect and bounce around in your mind bouncing those ideas off someone to see where did it connect with them where

###  [The Currency of Life: Collecting and Connecting with Interesting People](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3e5f369f-1738-4e13-b35c-31bb129a5f39) 

🎧 32:32 - 33:58 (01:26)

Success is not solely about money but about connecting with interesting people and having stimulating conversations. Being surrounded by intelligent individuals and engaging in lively discourse can be more energizing than professional success. Similar to how the Medici family's funding of artists and thinkers sparked the Renaissance, finding a community of big thinkers can inspire personal growth and creativity.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Sahil Bloom:** the entire game. I mean, if I have one goal in life, I don't care much about money. Paradoxically, I've made much more money when I stopped caring about money, which is, I think, probably a common thread among really successful people. But I really care about my currency of life, if you will, is the interesting people I feel like I can collect in my life and connect with each other and spend time around. Because I feel more energy having an amazing conversation with someone I think is really smart one-on or being in a room where there's five people having this amazing conversation that I get to be a fly on the wall for than almost anything else in my life in a professional-ish setting. and designers and artists and architects in 15th century Florence. And all of them flocked to Florence at one point in time in history because the Medicis were the first people that were actually funding their work. All of a sudden, you have this unbelievably lively discourse in one place at one point in time. And what happens? The Renaissance gets sparked. You have to find in your own life how to get yourself into that little mini 15th century Florence. Like what is that for your life? For a lot of people, their college campus is the first time they feel that. They're in an environment with big thinkers and people that they're around. And

###  [The Importance of Honest Writing and Anti-Status Play](https://share.snipd.com/snip/44f4dc3e-b96e-43a1-8471-5d089d6c0e60) 

🎧 38:46 - 40:08 (01:21)

It is crucial for writers to have brutal honesty with themselves about their word choices, ensuring they are used for accuracy and adding life to the writing rather than posturing for status. The concept can be applied to life decisions, questioning if one would still do or buy something if they couldn't tell anyone about it. This approach cuts through status games and reveals true intentions. Similarly, in writing, one should examine if a word is used for genuine utility or merely to impress others. Interestingly, anti-status behavior can become a status play, as seen when wealthy individuals flaunt driving modest cars.

#### 📚 Transcript

**David Perell:** I think that as a writer, you need to have a brutal honesty with yourself. When am I using a big word to posture? And when am I using a big word because it's accurate and it's adding life to what I'm writing? And it's really easy to deceive yourself there. This

**Sahil Bloom:** makes me think of status. So my whole, like my razor for status, if you will, like how I cut through the noise on this is, would you do this thing or would you buy this thing if you couldn't tell anyone in the world about it? That's good. And if the answer is no, it's just a BS status game that you're playing. That doesn't mean you shouldn't still do it. Maybe you want to flex on the nice watch or you want to flex on the car or the private jet or whatever the is, but just know that you're doing it for the flex. You're doing it for the status. You're not doing it for the utility. The same exact rule applies to writing. Are you writing that word because you want other people to be like, wow, David, you're so smart? Or are you writing that word because it adds incremental utility to the sentence that you're putting out?

**David Perell:** Well, also, sometimes what you think is going to impress other people doesn't impress

**Sahil Bloom:** other people. The funny thing is now anti-status stuff is a status play. Like where, you know, billionaires or like multimillionaires love to flex on the fact that they drive a shitty car. Like you'll see super rich people be like, yeah, I still drive my, you know, I still drive my

###  [The Art of Communicating Complex Ideas Simply](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fac6967f-f816-4265-84d3-a96986b4cf13) 

🎧 39:02 - 39:16 (00:13)

- To cut through the noise of status, ask yourself: Would you do or buy this if you couldn't tell anyone?
- If the answer is no, you're playing a status game.
- This doesn't mean you shouldn't do it, but be honest with yourself about why.

Sahil Bloom on how to determine if something is truly valuable or just a status symbol.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Sahil Bloom:** makes me think of status. So my whole, like my razor for status, if you will, like how I cut through the noise on this is, would you do this thing or would you buy this thing if you couldn't tell anyone in the world about it? That's

###  [Creating Consumable Content](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f3258641-a278-4495-b3ae-62b9ccd0447f) 

🎧 41:12 - 43:03 (01:50)

The speaker believes in creating content that is concise, valuable, and to the point, avoiding unnecessary filler. They express a disdain for nonfiction books filled with excessive filler and express a desire to provide content that is valuable and not overly drawn out. The speaker emphasizes the importance of creating content that they themselves would want to consume and find value in. They also highlight the impact of meeting someone on their email list growth, indicating a shift in their perspective on the importance of email as a valuable medium.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Sahil Bloom:** always found it helpful to create things that I would actually want to consume. And I consider myself reasonably smart, at least on paper. But I don't want to consume complicated sounding things that are super dense and super long. I want to consume things that get to the freaking point. Yeah. And get to it and then leave. Mm-hmm. I, like, labor the point. I mean, my biggest lamentation about nonfiction as a category of books is that it is entirely filled by books. you get the point 15 pages and then there's 185 pages of filler behind it. And now having gone through a book process and selling a book to publishers, I understand why. Because they want you to write the most narrow version of the topic that you want to write about. Like when I was going and talking about my book, it's like, oh, well, why don't you just pick one? You know, I wanted to have these five sections. Like, why don't you just pick one of those and just do that one thing? And my whole point to them was that's not going to, that basically is going to be my exact thing that I hate about the book industry. It's going to become a book where you could have gotten the point in 10 pages, but now I'm giving it to you in 200. Good luck. Go have fun with it. And I don't want to do that. I don't want to spend two years of my life working on something that 85% of people aren't going to read or aren't going to enjoy or get value from. And so I often think that when I'm putting something out, before I hit send, would I want to read this? Would I get value from this?

**David Perell:** Yeah. When I look at your email list growth, there was a huge uptick, an inflection point in October, 2022. What

**Sahil Bloom:** happened? So there are two inflection points. The first inflection point was when I met you. So I'm going to give you, I'll give you your flowers here. I had never thought of email as something that mattered. I

###  [Outsourcing Operations to Scale Business](https://share.snipd.com/snip/63502dd1-36e3-4e90-a3e3-c9a91961f419) 

🎧 44:54 - 45:42 (00:48)

The speaker recognized the need for a chief of staff to oversee operations and engaged a person familiar with his work to manage the back-end tasks related to newsletter growth. This decision was influenced by discussions with the founder of ConvertKit, Nathan Berry, and led to the creation of a service for managing and growing the newsletter.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Sahil Bloom:** biggest thing was I needed a, call it a chief of staff, effectively, who could oversee all the operations. I had worked with my, the guy that had done my website for me, I knew really well because I'd worked with him for a year. Is

**David Perell:** this Shane? Shane,

**Sahil Bloom:** yeah. And we started talking, started explaining to him some of the headaches and some of the pain points with it. I had become really close with Nathan Berry, the founder at ConvertKit. We were talking about a bunch of this stuff. And so then I told Shane, like, why don't I start paying you to manage all of this backend stuff to help me create, you know, basically like newsletter growth as a service effectively, like all the backend stuff that I'm doing to try to manage and grow the newsletter. And what are the different parts of Like,

**David Perell:** how would you map that out?

**Sahil Bloom:** Yeah, so basic

###  [Staying on the Cutting Edge of Distribution as a Creator](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c5c7d32b-f7fc-4f19-9e80-b50f8c85fc52) 

🎧 48:50 - 49:38 (00:48)

The principles of writing are timeless, while distribution principles are timely. Creators stay on the cutting edge of distribution by learning best practices from others and across all mediums, including newsletters. They focus on understanding referral programs and driving growth, as well as exploring best practices around paid ads.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Sahil Bloom:** now it's like newsletter ops and growth as a service that gets offered.

**David Perell:** Yeah, it's funny. I feel like the principles of writing are about as timeless as it gets. And I think the principles of distribution are about as timely as it gets. So what do you do as a creator to stay on the cutting edge of distribution? And how do you think about that? Is it talking to other people? And how has it changed over time as well? Yeah,

**Sahil Bloom:** I'm constantly trying to learn best practices from other people, what's working for them, what's not working for them. And that applies across all mediums, by the way, like newsletters one, and it's probably my biggest focus to what I get most excited about. So I want to know, like, I went deep on what did Morning Brew do with their referral program? How did they drive so much growth with a referral program in the early days, which is free effectively, you know, their shirts and mugs and stuff, but pretty free. What are the best practices around paid ads?

###  [The Challenge of Content Creation and Evolving Perspectives](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9d877d3d-6ada-4c6c-a86f-00e61d4e07b2) 

🎧 56:03 - 57:06 (01:03)

Content creators often find it strange that people hold them to their past work, even when their perspectives have evolved and changed over time. This phenomenon was exemplified by a Hollywood actress who was recognized for a character she played years ago, despite being a different person now. The experience highlights the challenge of reconciling the fluidity of personal growth with the permanence of written content, creating a sense of unease for creators.

#### 📚 Transcript

**David Perell:** of the strange things about creating content is that often people read things that you've written that you now disagree with and they'll hold you to those things i was talking to a friend of mine she's a hollywood actress named jennifer morrison and she was uh she was in house and uh was Emma Swan played that character. And she was one time walking in New York and someone came up to her and like jumped on her and was like, I love this character that you played like 10 years ago. And she's like, that was me 10 years ago. Like, I'm so different from now. And I think that there's this weird way that time shows up when you're writing and when you're sharing your ideas. Because you're like a river. You're in a state of constant flux, constant change, constant seasons. But there's something that is set in stone about writing. And I find the juxtaposition between those two things to be a little spooky, actually. Do

###  [Importance of Conciseness and Distillation in Communication](https://share.snipd.com/snip/327e4f5e-dba2-4645-80e2-a63c10064744) 

🎧 01:09:11 - 01:10:28 (01:16)

The speaker values conciseness and distilling ideas to the shortest possible version. They aim to remove any unnecessary words or fluff from their communication. They prefer to start with a concise version and then expand, rather than writing in long form and trying to distill later. This approach helps them find the shiny essence or the smallest thing they are trying to convey. They believe that when the main point is clear, everything else can orbit around it, similar to how verses in a song point back to the chorus.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Sahil Bloom:** anything

**David Perell:** um

**Sahil Bloom:** very very light usually on most things that I create um what

**David Perell:** matters to you the

**Sahil Bloom:** shortest possible version of how I could say something. The shortest. Yeah. And I shouldn't, I mean, you know, it's like the most concise version of how I could get an idea across. If there's like extra words and extra commas and, you know, all of the, any like, anything that's adding fluff to something that could have been distilled further, I try to strip out. It's the reason that for the longest time, I wrote things first on Twitter and then expanded on them elsewhere, because that forces you to have the most distilled version of the idea. Then you can expand on it, and it's going to be much better. When I get away from that, the writing is worse. Like when I write it in the long form, and then I try to distill it, it's

**David Perell:** worse. We have an idea and write a passage called the shiny dime. You got to find your shiny dime. And it's just always a reminder to just find that shiny essence, that the smallest thing that you're trying to say, because when you know what that main point is, everything else orbits around it. It's like a chorus in a song right every verse points back to the chorus and

###  [Finding the Essence for Effective Writing](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9f490b7f-127c-4f18-b8ce-adec3fbfcbc5) 

🎧 01:10:05 - 01:11:29 (01:24)

The key to effective writing is to find the 'shiny dime', the essence of what you're trying to say. This central point serves as the core around which everything else revolves, just like a chorus in a song. Sometimes this essence is discovered before writing, in the form of a one-liner or phrase. However, more often than not, it is found through a process of removing 'sludge' from the initial draft. It may take time and persistence to uncover the 'shiny dime', but once found, it can synthesize the entire piece into a clear and powerful statement.

#### 📚 Transcript

**David Perell:** Yeah. have an idea and write a passage called the shiny dime. You got to find your shiny dime. And it's just always a reminder to just find that shiny essence, that the smallest thing that you're trying to say, because when you know what that main point is, everything else orbits around it. It's like a chorus in a song right every verse points back to the chorus and until you have that clarity i think it's hard to write really well now sometimes that shiny dime comes to you before you start writing where you have a nice one line or you have a nice phrase you have a nice sentence we're like that is the essence of what i'm trying to say but i find more often than not it's actually the. I throw a bunch of sludge onto the page and it's only in the process of removing, of trying to find the needle in the haystack, so to speak, that then later I stumble upon what that thing is. And often it takes me years. I

**Sahil Bloom:** have had that exact same experience. You have to crawl through the mud in order to find the shiny dime. I had this one line. I write a lot about this idea of finding enough in your life. The definition is of enough. And I crawled through the mud on a piece about this for several weeks. And then one morning I woke up with this thing in my mind of never let the quest for more distract you from the beauty of enough. And I was like, oh my God. Like it synthesized the entire piece into this one sentence for me. And

###  [Identifying and pursuing one's unique gifts in the modern era](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a9add7a1-2134-4084-bfea-7bfaa12718ca) 

🎧 01:20:52 - 01:22:12 (01:19)

The challenge lies in finding individuals who can help recognize one's true gifts. It is important to have the courage to acknowledge when one is not gifted in a certain area. Once these are identified, it is crucial to pursue endeavors that align with one's unique gifts rather than conforming to societal or parental expectations. In the modern era, it is possible to create credibility without adhering to traditional credentialism, as the barriers to entry are being dismantled.

#### 📚 Transcript

**David Perell:** Amen. Amen. I mean, the thing that I think is very hard is to have the people in your life who can help you figure out what it is that you're actually gifted at. That's the first thing. And then the second is to have the courage to say, this is something I would like to be gifted at, but I'm not gifted at that. And then once you find those two things, to then be able to chase the things that are unique and that are true to your gifts and lack of gifts instead of the expectations of your parents and of your friends and of society and of the media to do something that is unique and distinct instead of doing what I feel like how you were feeling working in private equity, which is far more standard coming out of a place like Stanford than being an online creator.

**Sahil Bloom:** We also live in the most amazing time in history to do this. You know, the walls of credentialism are permanently cracked and being torn down on a daily basis. And you can create credibility around something without having to go get a $200,000 degree.
