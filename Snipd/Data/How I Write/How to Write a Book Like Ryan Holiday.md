## Snips

###  [Defining Success in Creative Projects](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e030f670-9f2b-4e2a-8211-1e071816772f) 

🎧 07:07 - 08:22 (01:14)

When evaluating the success of a creative project, focus on aspects within your control such as the quality of the work, creative fulfillment, and personal growth. Avoid becoming disconnected from the meaning of your work by deliberately staying mindful of your intentions. Measure success not just by external factors like sales or media attention but also by personal factors like improved life balance and emotional well-being during the project.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ryan Holiday:** one, I probably, I think it'll be maybe sell the most or the second most of any of the books. And I certainly got the most media. Like I was just in New York doing a bunch of stuff. And there was a part of it that felt a little disassociated because I wasn't thinking about, like I was just sort of deliberately not thinking about what any of it meant. And there's a part of that that can be kind of a form of ingratitude or disconnection that I don't think is good. But you want on a creative project, because so much of it is outside of your control to define success as much as possible to things that are up to you. So like, is it the best thing that you wrote? Did you leave it all, you know, in the pages versus whatever? Was it creatively fulfilling? Did you like, I've even tried to measure my projects now, like, how, was this less disruptive in my life than previous projects? Like, did I just get better at being a normal person while I was doing it as opposed to it, like, consuming your life?

###  [Earned Confidence Over Ego](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6dd08505-ad90-4a6e-b34c-d123d7dd2a3d) 

🎧 11:37 - 12:26 (00:49)

The journey of gaining confidence involves experiencing lows that are less intense, detaching success from self-worth, and recognizing that confidence is earned through personal experience rather than being told by others. Through personal struggles and challenges, one gains the assurance that they are capable, leading to true confidence over mere ego.

#### 📚 Transcript

**David Perell:** Sure. You've also spoken about how it seems like the lows have gotten less low. It seems like early on, as you were writing, there was a real sense of, I don't know, the success of the book or maybe the success of your writing, you'll have better words for it, was very tied to your sense of self-worth. And that seems to have gone away a little bit. What are the things that you felt that you needed to learn over the past few years? And are these things that somebody could have told you? Or are they things like, you know what? I just needed to go through hell a few times, learn this on my own to get out through the tunnel. I mean, there's really

**Ryan Holiday:** only one way to get confidence, and that's to earn it, right? I think any kind of confidence that's not earned is probably better defined as ego. And so one of the things you get from having done it is the sense that you can do it. Like,

###  [Confidence is Earned Through Experience](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4f6a84d8-1ed2-4727-ad25-12073f43ee7f) 

🎧 12:09 - 13:22 (01:13)

Confidence is earned through experience, not something that can be gained without having gone through the process. Only after going through the ups and downs of a process can one truly trust it. The more you experience something, the more you understand its patterns and rhythms. Starting each new project from scratch is a challenge in writing because the success of the previous one does not guarantee success in the next.

#### 📚 Transcript

**David Perell:** I mean, there's really

**Ryan Holiday:** only one way to get confidence, and that's to earn it, right? I think any kind of confidence that's not earned is probably better defined as ego. And so one of the things you get from having done it is the sense that you can do it. Like, you know that expression, trust the process? I think we kind of throw that out, like trust the process. Well, it's very hard to trust a process that you have not been through. And so when you have been through the process, you can trust it because you've felt all the parts of it, right? And so, you know, Paul Graham talks about the trough of despair. Every project has a trough of despair and you feel it in a book, but the first time you feel it, you're like, what is this? And then the second time you feel it, you're like, oh, is it different this time? And then the third time you feel it, go, no, no, no, this is what happens. And so the more you do it, the more the rhythms of it you have. And I think one of the hard parts about writing is that you're always starting. Your last project doesn't write your next one. So you're starting from nothing.

###  [Trust the Process of Writing](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2750860d-2185-49f2-92ef-896789b101c7) 

🎧 15:51 - 17:07 (01:16)

Trusting the writing process involves embracing uncertainty and allowing connections to naturally emerge during the research. Continuously going through notes and observations may reveal a coherent chapter or theme over time. By refraining from judging individual pieces as good or bad, the overall content can come together in a surprising and satisfying way, often exceeding initial expectations. The process involves almost 'time traveling' by leaving reminders for a future self, ultimately leading to a better and more well-told final product.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ryan Holiday:** it was a white index card and I wrote on it with red Sharpie. I said, when you go through these cards in June, it's going to feel like there's not a book here, but there is. Just keep going through the cards and you'll find it. And I don't know why I wrote that. And I don't honestly know when I wrote it, but it was like exactly what, it was just a reminder. Okay. Trust the process. So I did, I just, I'm going to just keep going through these note cards and I'm not going to judge it as good or bad, or I'm just going to do the thing and I'll let it happen. And, you know, maybe a couple of days later, I did think of her or I thought of someone else and, and suddenly patterns started to emerge. That's the cool part about going through your research is you realize you'd been making connections, but not realizing that you'd been making connections. So you'd written down 20 things on the same theme, but you'd done them months apart. So they felt like individual observations when actually what was coalescing was a chapter or a theme. And so anyways, the book does start to come together and it came together much faster than I thought. And ultimately the book was different, but better than I thought. And it's sold better than I thought. But what I loved about that was like, it was like, how did I time travel that way? Like, how did I send a note to a future version of myself? And that's what the process is.

###  [Reading to Lead](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4774fb52-7440-4c48-a394-2c3623ebdd6c) 

🎧 40:27 - 41:39 (01:11)

The act of memorizing passages can lead to a deep understanding, as the content 'seeps into your heart'. However, just memorizing something does not equate to truly knowing it. There is an essential difference between memorizing and understanding the material. It is highlighted that to do great things, one must read not just for the sake of reading, but to lead. This concept of 'reading to lead' emphasizes the importance of reading with the intention of applying the knowledge gained to lead and make a positive impact.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ryan Holiday:** you someone who would memorize passages

**David Perell:** and quotes? Or are you like, I'm going to read it and move on? No,

**Ryan Holiday:** no, I definitely remember. I don't deliberately memorize, but like from my repeated use of stuff, it gets in there and it's like bouncing around. One

**David Perell:** of my favorite metaphors in the English language is that to know something, to memorize something, is to know it by heart, and that it seeps into your heart. I think that there's something profound about that.

**Ryan Holiday:** Yeah, Montaigne also said, though, to know by heart is not to know. I think he's saying that just because you memorized it doesn't mean you know it. Look at school, right? Yeah. And so there's something also about like it sort of rattling around in there and then you get it some, at

**David Perell:** some level you have to get it more than just knowing it. Of

**Ryan Holiday:** course. Let's

**David Perell:** talk about reading. So there was a conversation that you had many years ago. Here's what you say. The best piece of advice I've ever got about reading came from a secretive movie producer and talent manager who'd sold more than a hundred million albums and done more than a billion dollars in box office returns. He said to me one day, Ryan, it's not enough that you read a lot. To do great things, you have to read to lead. What is it about read to lead that really resonated with you? Well,

###  [Making a Positive Contribution Every Day](https://share.snipd.com/snip/dd8e2874-923a-4c42-b00e-7df6ad25eb5b) 

🎧 49:15 - 50:37 (01:22)

The speaker aims to make a positive contribution each day, even if it's just restructuring a chapter or adding new content to a book. They prioritize quality over quantity, focusing on the impact of their work rather than the hours spent. By evaluating their daily contribution based on this standard, they feel satisfied with their progress.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ryan Holiday:** just struck by something. I don't know what it's for. But, but hopefully it's for something. So that's kind of the, that's kind of the process. So like today isn't going to be a super productive day because I'm still putting out this book, but like I got, I don't know, 50-ish minutes of like focus on this chapter that I was writing. And I was actually doing something from the Eric Larson thing that I was just telling you about. And so my kind of rule, just think about it as like, did I make like a positive contribution today? So like, would it be nice to make several hours of positive contribution? Sure. But like, I've re basically I, I'd already written the chapter, but the way I, there's no, I restructured it and reoriented and I'm adding this new stuff. And so some version of that will end up in the final product. So I feel good about the contribution that I made today. How

**David Perell:** much are you reading for style as opposed to content? What does that mean? For example, I've spoken to a lot of authors who, speaking for myself, I would like to get better describing things. So what I'll do is I'll read David Wallace. And as I'm working on a piece, I'll go through David Foster Wallace. And the content of the way that he describes the sink on the cruise ship is fine. I mean, it's beautiful, but that's not really what I'm going for.

###  [Embrace the Ugliness of the Early Creative Process](https://share.snipd.com/snip/95780375-49b7-4662-8f0e-c67c480e0086) 

🎧 01:02:21 - 01:03:49 (01:27)

The fear of the blank page arises because the initial work is never as good as what is envisioned in the mind, leading to discomfort during the creative process. People may hold onto projects due to this fear, but it is important to embrace the ugliness of the early creative stages to progress and create something beautiful.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ryan Holiday:** Well, the blank page is scary because it sucks. You know, like your finished stuff, whatever it is, it's done and it's as good as it could be. So that's, you know, it exists. And the blank page is scary. And I think there's also something humbling and awful about what's on the page is never as good as what's in your head. And so if you keep it in your head, it's safe and good. And you're not going through this awful, uncomfortable, middle period, like this teenage growth spurt adolescence, you know, awkwardness. And it's easier just to keep it there. And I think this is why people hang on to projects or write and rewrite them. they, they're just, there's, every part of the process is scary and you find one and you can kind of develop almost like a phobia. And

**David Perell:** there's a real ugliness to the early creative process. So if you go to Florence and you see the statue of David, what I didn't realize is the statue is beautiful, but there's a, I think it's called the Hall of Prisoners. And you see these uncompleted statues by Michelangelo and they look demented. They are so ugly. And they're like almost a person, but they're definitely not a person still. And to see the difference between the statue of David and these ugly

###  [Overcoming Procrastination and Imposter Syndrome](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f1fb2eae-5279-4693-b9dd-066023d1e9b8) 

🎧 01:03:59 - 01:05:06 (01:07)

Facing a daunting task of working with a valuable yet flawed block of marble, the fear of making mistakes and imperfections can lead to procrastination and imposter syndrome. The perfection sought in the final product can be intimidating, causing endless delays and reasons for not starting the task. It is common for individuals to keep preparing to begin without actually taking action, as the fear of failure looms large.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ryan Holiday:** if I remember correctly, they gave him this enormous block of marble that was incredibly valuable and different sculptors had vied for it and couldn't figure it. It's like, huge block that he's given, right? Huge, yeah. And I think it was like somewhat flawed or something. Like he had to be creative with how he used it. But you can imagine for him, the sort of both imposter syndrome and procrastination that would come in from like, knowing like, hey, you fuck up a lot in the process. And as long as it's this unformed, untouched thing, it's perfect in one sense. And that the perfection that I'm trying to get on the other side, the risk is when you start because you could fuck it up. And you could imagine coming up with endless delays and reasons for not doing it because you want to get it right. There's a Seneca thing. He the one thing all fools have in common is that they're always getting ready to start. And so there's always something, some reason why you're like, okay,
