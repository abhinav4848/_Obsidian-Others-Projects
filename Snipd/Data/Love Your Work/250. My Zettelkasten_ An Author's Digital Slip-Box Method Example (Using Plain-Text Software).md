###  [Misconceptions about Note Taking](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b5fbabd6-d1a1-4cee-9ea0-fce3b29df56c) 

🎧 02:49 - 04:11 (01:21)

Note taking doesn't take away from reading pleasure and can be done in a low effort and creative way. It's not boring and can keep you engaged. Notes are not simple records and cannot be substituted by Google. Your own thoughts are inherent in the note-taking process.

#### 📚 Transcript

Some misconceptions i had. One, note taking does not take the pleasure away from reading. Note taking doesn't have to take more mental effort than reading. It can be broken into low effort activities that build into something great. Additionally, you can still read for pleasure. Not all my reading goes through my note taking process. Two, note taking is not mindlessly writing down everything you read. Note taking connect your consumption of knowledge with your creation of knowledge. If you mindlessly write down everything, there's no room for creativity. Only take notes on the parts of your reading that interest you or that you otherwise want to retain. Three, note taking is not boring. Some parts of note taking look boring. For example, looking at a high light you've made than writing it in your own words looks boring, but it's fun. It's just enough of a challenge to keep you engaged. For google is not a substitute for your notes. Your notes are not simple records of facts and figures. You would not get the same results just by goggling anything you'd like to reference. Inherent in the system is your own thoughts.

###  [Choosing Plain Text for Better Portability and Simplicity in Note Taking](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4490426a-ac2a-40d1-b884-89719474b61c) 

🎧 04:21 - 05:50 (01:28)

After using Evernote for ten years and finding it slow and bloated, I wanted a more portable and simple solution. I prefer plain text and Markdown for its offline capability and ease of use. My notes are stored as .md files in folders on my hard drive and synced to Dropbox. I primarily use Obsidian on desktop and OneWriter on iPad, occasionally using Ulysses for its multi-file preview. My note-taking structure includes fleeting, literature, and permanent notes, as well as additional categories like inbox and someday/maybe. Literature notes condense entire pieces like articles or books.

#### 📚 Transcript

For me, after using ever note for ten years and watching it get slow and bloated, i didn't want to get locked into any particular software. A lot of zettle casting practitioners love rome research, which is very ful. But i like the portability, simplicity and off line capability of plain text. I love writing in mark down, which is a simple, human readable way of adding form, adding and links to plain text. My notes are text files with the extension dot m d, sitting in folders on my hard drive, and are also sinked to drop box. Since my notes are plain text files, i can access them on a ton of different software i mostly work through obsidian on desk top and one writer on eye pad. I also sometimes use ulysses because i like how it allows me to preview the contents of many files at once. As i covered in my how to take smart notes book. Summary, the general structure of a zetl castin is fleeting notes, literature notes and permanent notes. I also have three additional categories, in box, somday maybe and raw fleeting notes i take in my tiny moleskin volant or on the drafts ap or in any of my other paper note books. Literature notes are any condensed notes i've made of an entire piece, such as an article or book.
