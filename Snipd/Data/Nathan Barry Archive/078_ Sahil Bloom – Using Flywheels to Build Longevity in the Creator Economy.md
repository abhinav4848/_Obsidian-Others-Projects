###  [Aligning Creative Energy with Peak Productivity](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4fd36083-ee21-4908-9ff9-41dd31ad06ea) 

🎧 16:51 - 18:38 (01:46)

Understanding one's unique circadian rhythm and peak creative energy flow is crucial to maximizing productivity. By identifying the time when creative energy is at its peak and aligning it with the most important creative tasks, such as writing, individuals can optimize their output. Mapping daily activities based on energy levels can help prioritize high-value creative work during peak energy times. Creating an 'energy calendar' to differentiate activities that generate energy from those that drain it is a valuable strategy for boosting productivity and content creation.

#### 📚 Transcript

I think that you need to figure out your own kind of energy cadence around creating. I'll talk about it during my talk this afternoon. But one of the things I always think is we all have a very different circadian rhythm and a very different time when our creative energy is flowing in the way that is required for you to create at your highest level. I used to think I could write in the evening because that was when it fit into my day and my life. And what I realized was I actually was my sharpest, most creative version of myself at five in the morning. And that's just me being a weird morning person. I like waking up early, but I was doing a bunch of emailing at five in the morning rather than spending that time on the one creative thing that actually mattered. That was really high leverage. So figuring out for me, when my creative energy actually was flowing and then mapping that to when I was actually creating on a daily basis was really, really important. And that to me is just a matter of mapping out your life of what is the actual real important thing that you're doing on a daily basis from a creative standpoint. Writing for me is that number one most important thing, whether it's my newsletter, whether it's my book that I should be working on or writing for Twitter or whatever other platform, I need that to be in the morning because that's when I actually have creative energy flowing. In the afternoon, I'm basically useless after 2.30. I just like my energy goes to zero. I need six Dunkin Donuts cold brews in order to do anything. And so if I could email or if I'd have to get on a zoom call in the afternoon, that's okay. I don't mind going and doing that or doing whatever the lower value task is. But mapping my energy to when I'm creating has been really, really impactful for me. Yeah, I

like it. I've

seen it play out just in the volume of content that you create.

The one thing I would encourage everyone to do is I have this thing I created. I called it an energy calendar. But basically it's like looking at the activities that are on your calendar during the course of a week that create energy versus drain energy from your life.

###  [From Cost Centers to Profit Centers](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2be4cef0-2fb7-4d63-a0a0-1351e6cd96a3) 

🎧 29:14 - 30:37 (01:22)

Equity in a business can be yielded through investing in startups with huge growth potential or in services that generate cash flow from day one. Transforming cost centers into profit centers is essential for financial efficiency, as seen in the model of Amazon turning expenses into income-generating ventures.

#### 📚 Transcript

Although equity in a business that cash flows from day one,

might buy the groceries just more specifically around the ecosystem that I've focused on. I have a venture fund that invests in early stage startups, small venture fund. Those are all 10 plus year bets companies that are money losing today that you're predicting or going to build a huge ecosystem around them. Amazing founder is building big, big solutions. There's no cash in that type of stuff. You're hoping for a billion dollar plus exits. The other end of the spectrum of business types are these cash flow from day one agencies, services, these businesses that just create value from day one. A lot of the businesses you guys run and have built are in that mold, coaching businesses, whatever it might be around the agency model, you can go build businesses like that that are going to make you cash and real cash flow from day one. And so for me,

I've thought about, I

have reached of say 2 million people across these different platforms. And there are a lot of things that I was doing on a daily basis or monthly basis that I was spending money on, video editing services, design services, newsletter growth services, people building my newsletter on the backend, all the ops around it. And I was spending cash on that every single month. And I just looked at it from an Amazon model of Amazon turned all of their cost centers into profit centers. How can I do that exact same thing? Well, if I'm spending five grand a month on video editing services that are going to chop up videos and eclipse, I should actually own a video editing business.

###  [Setting Goals and Anti-Goals for Successful Collaboration](https://share.snipd.com/snip/308ed07d-6fba-4470-a958-6ae4fe0ae5c8) 

🎧 42:24 - 43:50 (01:26)

It is crucial for individuals collaborating to clearly define their goals and anti-goals from the outset to avoid potential failures. By openly discussing what they want to achieve and what they must avoid, they can align their efforts effectively. This approach was exemplified when two agency partners set a maximum time limit to spend on a project to ensure success. By setting a north star goal and being adaptable in the implementation strategy, individuals can build a sustainable business without the pressure of foreseeing the exact future. Continuously evaluating strategies and being committed to what works best are key to long-term success.

#### 📚 Transcript

It might make sense for someone else. And they should probably work with that other person then in that case. And so just being really eyes wide open with the people about what the goal is and what the anti goal is, what would make this a disaster for both of

us. And when we were starting our agency together, we

had a discussion with our CEO of what are our goals for this and what are our anti goals? What do we want to make sure we avoid along the way here? And for both of us, we have full time things that we're working on in building our anti goal is spending more than X hours a week on this makes it a total, total failure. And so if we're building a model that requires us to spend that much time on it, it's not going to work. And we already know that. So we can avoid it from the get go. So I think that that helps also at that at the outset is having that discussion. I love it.

Let's do a few more from the side of the room. Who

over here has one? That one's out the sides. Yeah, exactly. This is kind of a ridiculous question. But 10 years from now, what do you think the creator ecosystem looks like? I'm

terrible at predicting the future.

The way I think about it as

a company is if I have the north star of helping creators in our living, and I just continue to follow that north star, then the exact way that that plays out,

I'm not

married to one implementation of that, or oh, this feature or this way we do business. It's really just continually checking in what's working and be relentless on that. And I think that allows me to build a business that is long term sustainable without having to have a really clear idea of, oh, I know exactly what 10 years from now, this is going to look like.

###  [Evolving Creator Ecosystem](https://share.snipd.com/snip/68bb4005-7f02-441c-8d3b-e06daab6169e) 

🎧 43:06 - 44:29 (01:22)

Focusing on a north star of helping creators and continually evaluating what works best without being attached to specific implementations is crucial for long-term sustainable business growth. Trends suggest that audience sizes will continue to grow rapidly with the global population coming online. The shift in attention dynamics shows commerce follows attention, with a previous centralization of attention now diversifying as more individuals gain access to online platforms.

I think a lot of trends are going to continue. I think audience sizes are going to continue to grow like crazy. I was saying in my talk, I just see even global population growth, and then the population's coming online. That's absolutely huge. And we're still in this really small ecosystem compared to even

just current online populations. I like general mental model for this is commerce follows attention. And 50

years ago, attention was highly centralized. The biggest conglomerates owned all of the airwaves, and they had every single ad space they owned. It was P&G, it was the handful of big companies owned all of the attention in their space.

###  [Focus on credibility, connections, attention, and community for early-stage business](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d43e0e4e-aa09-4d9e-9f8a-b461dee7dc90) 

🎧 45:54 - 46:43 (00:48)

An early-stage new creator business idea needs to concentrate on building credibility, connections, attention, and community. It is vital to prioritize these aspects over focusing solely on growth hacking to ensure the success of the business venture.

#### 📚 Transcript

You had a question and I think we have time for one more after that. So think

of your question the final one. Thanks Bob. I appreciate your time. Interesting you asked that question because I was going to ask do we see aggregators coming in and trying to pull back and do that but you kind of already answered that. So my second question would be this. What's something that an early stage new creator business idea needs to concentrate on if they're looking to build? I've heard Nathan use this term a lot in an enterprise style business because you have so many things going on. I would imagine when you first left PE world that you can say I want to have these 15 things going. There was a point somewhere where it started to

add up. I think it has to be credible connected attention and community first for all of this stuff to work. I don't think any of it worth the their growth hacking. We've all seen it, right?

###  [True Connection over Fast Growth](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5e7efebb-2584-4a00-9d3e-1cadd872b0cc) 

🎧 46:33 - 48:00 (01:26)

In the long term, credibility, genuine human connection, and community are crucial for building a sustainable and durable business. Rapid growth through attention-grabbing tactics like AI or trendy technologies may not lead to real connections with the audience. Instead, focusing on creating true connections with a smaller, loyal audience is key. The concept of '1000 True Fans' by Kevin Kelly remains relevant, emphasizing the importance of human connections in the face of commoditization of technology over time.

#### 📚 Transcript

I think it has to be credible connected attention and community first for all of this stuff to work. I don't think any of it worth the their growth hacking. We've all seen it, right? If you are building something for the next 10, 15, 20 years, you've all been frustrated by it too where you see someone growing super fast by doing whatever the chat GPT thread is AI, whatever it was web three before it was Chrome extensions before that. Whatever the thing was that people grew really fast with that has all that will continue to exist but it will be very, very difficult to build a credible durable long-term commerce center around that because the attention is fake in a lot of ways. It's not a real connection that you have with your audience. So I think that the community, the real human connection that you build with people has to be at the center of how you think if you're getting started.

If I were to start from scratch today, that's what I would be focused on. It wouldn't be trying to grow to anywhere near the scale that my stuff has grown to. It would be really focusing on

how do I create true connection on a scale of a thousand. I think the Kevin Kelly, 1000 True Fans thing holds up entirely today and I think it will continue to over the 10 years ahead because again, all of the baseline stuff will become commoditized and that human connection is going to be what actually stands out.

I agree. Okay, final question.

Jay, all the way to back.

Making them work for it. That's right. Thank you

for sharing so much, Siles. It's been awesome. Super

to me.
