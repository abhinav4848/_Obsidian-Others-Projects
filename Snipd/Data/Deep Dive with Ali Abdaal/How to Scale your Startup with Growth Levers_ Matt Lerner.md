###  [Optimizing User Experience for Growth](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8f2e6702-2585-4239-a108-c5237e7b236b) 

🎧 10:40 - 11:52 (01:12)

Sales and marketing contribute to growth through customer acquisition, but growth can also be driven by product improvements and operational efficiencies. By reframing compliance as a means to increase user engagement and platform activity, companies like Wise successfully optimize the user journey to enhance the customer experience and drive growth.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** in that sense, sales and marketing are a subset of growth?

**Matt Lerner:** There's certainly a big piece of it, obviously. Yeah, customer acquisition. But depending on your big levers and what they are, a lot of it could be driven by product. It could be driven by all sorts of things. Let's take the company Wise here in London, money remittances company. So anyone who wants to work with a fintech company, they have to go through this process called KYC, know your customer, which means that wise is legally required to verify some documents, source of funds, who you are, you're not a fraudster or whatever. So for most companies, that's just a giant pain and it's this thing you've got to do. But if you go to your head of compliance and you say, listen, your job isn't, you know, if you hire a head of compliance, they're going to want to do a good job and be a hundred percent compliant. And if you go to them and say, listen, that's not your job. Your job is to get as many weekly active users or as much money going through our platform as possible while remaining compliant, they're going to think about their job differently. So what Wise did was they smoothed out that process in a way and just really spent a lot of time on optimizing the user journey just to make that really painless and help people get up and running quickly.

###  [Identifying Growth Levers](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ef4405a1-ce82-4ca3-a958-596c880efe4a) 

🎧 12:42 - 13:39 (00:57)

Identifying growth levers involves mapping your growth model to understand the key actions that will have the most significant impact on your business's growth. By creating a mathematical representation of how your business acquires, delights, engages, retains, and monetizes customers, you can pinpoint the areas with the highest leverage for growth.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** Okay. That's super interesting. All right, I'm sold. So then what does growth levers mean? And why is that the title of the book? Yeah. it's an American book. So they're levers, just for the record. Levers. Yeah.

**Matt Lerner:** Now, it sounds so much better when you say it anyways. Levers. Levers. So these levers are, or levers or whatever they are, this is the work. These are the things, the actions that will have the biggest impact on the growth of your business that you need to identify. Sure. Okay. So how do we do that? So how do you do that? There's four steps to the process. The first step, why is it levers and process and not levers and process? Anyway, there's four steps to this process. The first thing, which I think we're going to do today, is you sort of map your growth model, which is a mathematical representation of how your business acquires and delights and engages and retains and monetizes customers. And once you've got some data in there, you can sort of mathematically derive where are the points of highest leverage.

###  [Testing the Impact of Books on Course Sales](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e690843c-7f65-4f8f-9b1b-1945289e7234) 

🎧 16:59 - 18:11 (01:12)

- To test the assumption that a book will drive course sales, find people who have both.
- Ask them directly about the book's impact on their course sales.
- This allows you to quickly gather data and validate your assumption, saving time and effort compared to writing a whole book first.

#### 💬 Quote

> Who do I know who has both a book and a course?
And [...] I can just email them and be like, Hey, quick question, to what extent did the book contribute to your course sales?
> — Ali Abdaal

Ali Abdaal on a quick way to test the assumption that a book will help increase course sales.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** so if i were thinking out loud with this example uh i would be thinking who do i know who has both a book and a course and in my position i can just email them and be like hey quick question to what extent did the contribute to your course sales i so i happen to know a handful of people who do this some of whom some of them have said it basically did nothing because they already had a youtube channel and the other one said it was massive because they didn't have a YouTube channel.

**Matt Lerner:** Those are

**Ali Abdaal:** like the two categories of like four people that I've spoken to for whom this scenario applies.

**Matt Lerner:** Okay, great. So you've now, in a week, de-risked or ruled out a bad idea or de-risked an assumption.

**Ali Abdaal:** So

**Matt Lerner:** for each of your experiments that you're most excited about, you figure out what's the quickest way we can test this. That's step three. And we can come back to any of these obviously, but then step four is a mindset shift. So it turns out that to grow a startup quickly, you pretty much have to have the exact opposite mindset that it would take to be successful in school or successful in a normal job. Oh, tell me more. And as you can imagine, people have trouble with this. So what do you do? You're a good student in school. How do you succeed in school? You

###  [Embrace Mistakes to Accelerate Growth](https://share.snipd.com/snip/eddda9be-0a5e-4615-9d94-95adeabeb740) 

🎧 17:34 - 19:29 (01:55)

To rapidly grow a startup, individuals need to shift their mindset from a perfectionist perspective common in school and traditional jobs. In a startup, making mistakes is inevitable and essential for learning and progress. It is crucial to embrace mistakes as each one contributes to learning and brings you closer to your goal. Documenting experiments and learnings is key to avoiding repetitive mistakes and fostering a culture where making and learning from mistakes is valued.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Matt Lerner:** Okay, great. So you've now, in a week, de-risked or ruled out a bad idea or de-risked an assumption.

**Ali Abdaal:** So

**Matt Lerner:** for each of your experiments that you're most excited about, you figure out what's the quickest way we can test this. That's step three. And we can come back to any of these obviously, but then step four is a mindset shift. So it turns out that to grow a startup quickly, you pretty much have to have the exact opposite mindset that it would take to be successful in school or successful in a normal job. Oh, tell me more. And as you can imagine, people have trouble with this. So what do you do? You're a good student in school. How do you succeed in school? You learn all the things really quickly, really thoroughly, and you remember them and you apply them without making any mistakes. Suppose you get a job as a consultant or a banker, an engineer or whatever. So how do you get promoted in a company? You do all the things they ask you to do, plus a few more things. You do them really, really well and you don't make any mistakes. Okay, so now you come into a startup and the deck is stacked against you. You can't do all the things that you know you should do. You've never done this before, so you're absolutely going to make mistakes and you need to move quickly, which you can't do all the things and you've got to make mistakes. And the value is those mistakes because each of those mistakes brings a little bit of learning and gets you actually closer to your goal.

**Ali Abdaal:** In theory, provided you learn from the mistake. Provided you learn from the experience. Yeah. Which I think is something we've been quite bad at in that we've often done things. And then only like two years later, we will remember, oh yeah, we did that thing. And we really should have written down what we learned from that because we've just made that mistake again. Actually,

**Matt Lerner:** part of the experiment process is document your experiments when you're done and document your learnings. But it's even worse with the mindset piece because someone who is afraid to make mistakes and thinks they're going to get, you know, a bad grade or fired or something isn't going to talk about them.

###  [Strategic Planning for Revenue Growth](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5ce1d43f-5ca0-436d-8ff1-a87cdefc180a) 

🎧 31:37 - 33:02 (01:25)

The process of deciding which work to pursue for revenue growth involves setting a revenue goal, breaking it down into achievable steps, evaluating existing revenue streams like sponsorships and academy courses, launching new products like a productivity lab for additional revenue, and considering factors like expertise within the team for potential expansion into B2B markets.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** if you're one of the first 200 people to use that link, you'll also get 20% off the annual premium subscription. So thank you so much, Brilliant, for sponsoring this episode. Good question. How do we decide which work to do? Partly it's, I mean, the process has changed over time. Initially, there was no process. Now the broad process is we, like what we did this year is that we were, I was like, okay, you know, everyone says you should have a revenue goal. This was before I read your book. Everyone says you should have a revenue goal. So let's aim for 10 million by the end of next year as the revenue goal. Now let's figure out how we break that down. What are the things that we could do with our existing things like our sponsorship revenue and our YouTuber Academy revenue to get to that point? Cool sponsorships. We can probably go from two to two and a half million. I don't really like doing sponsors. Don't tell the sponsors. So we don't want to grow that too much because it would probably require more effort for me. Our YouTuber Academy could probably grow and we could launch this new product, Productivity Lab, which is a thing that I've had in my mind and seems kind of cool. And it's like productivity and it's a community and it's membership and recurring revenue. You know, it's the ninth wonder of the world, apparently, after compound interest the eighth and so we thought okay cool let's create this product and hopefully we can grow that to like five million or something because it would be kind of cool we thought of do we want to do b2b and we thought we don't have the expertise in the team right now to do that so it would require having an external hire we

###  [Engage Subscribers with Content Variety and Vlogs](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3308b947-f788-445b-94d5-d12a023fad43) 

🎧 01:12:41 - 01:13:46 (01:05)

Content variety, such as videos covering a range of topics like productivity, relationships, business, and personal content, can keep viewers engaged even when not in problem-solving mode. Including vlogs on the main channel could boost the number of monthly returning viewers.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Matt Lerner:** you can start to have some thought around okay yeah um then what are the different levers that are gonna keep your engaged subscribers engaged? So you mentioned from the heart videos. Yeah,

**Ali Abdaal:** I think actually a broad range of topics is somewhat engaging. Uh, I have heard from some people that they like the fact that our channel has some videos about productivity, some about health, one or two about relationships, some about business, some about personal stuff. And so there's something about content variety that means that even if someone's not in problem solving mode, where it's like, you know, they might be like, oh, I don't want to watch this video about procrastination, but I'll watch a vlog or I'll watch this video about relationships, or I'll watch this video about tech. There's something about variety that helps keep existing viewers engaged. Okay.

**Matt Lerner:** So from the hard videos, variety.

**Ali Abdaal:** Yeah. And

**Matt Lerner:** any others? I mean, this doesn't have to be exhaustive. I think vlogs may well

**Ali Abdaal:** keep. Vlogs on the main channel would, I think, boost the monthly returning viewers number.

**Matt Lerner:** All right.

**Ali Abdaal:** Because
