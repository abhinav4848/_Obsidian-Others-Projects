## Snips

###  [The J Curve Business and the Role of Freelancers](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0b142c0a-2ce9-4428-9677-a0cc3da0ace4) 

🎧 25:43 - 27:44 (02:01)

A J curve business relies on a frictionless sales process, often involving free content or trials, while non J curve businesses require a sales process and significant cash transactions. This can lead to boutique businesses with multiple consultants collaborating. A freelancer is self-employed but may not be an ideal model due to the heavy workload and the need to charge a premium for shorter commitments.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Daniel Priestley:** Yeah. And you do if it's a J curve, but not if it's not. So typically the difference is the sales process. So a J-curve business normally relies on almost a frictionless sale where people either do a free piece of content or they do a free trial or they sit down at a restaurant expecting to spend $30 or something like that. So it's fairly frictionless. The non-J businesses normally have a sales process. So you're sitting down with a potential client and you're actually convincing them to part with a sizable chunk of cash. And normally it would be thousands to tens of thousands per sale. And you need to generate leads and then you need make the sale. So you have to sit down with that fashion business and say, look, here's how your current system works. Here's some of the best practices that you're leaving off of the table. And you might sell an initial scope of work that is like fact find or something like that. And then you present that and you come back and now you're presenting a piece of work. That can also turn into a boutique. So you could have three to 12 people working together doing supply chain consulting together. And all of that, everyone can be making great money in those types of businesses. So anything that involves a sales process is normally a non-J curve

**Ali Abdaal:** business. Interesting. Where does a freelancer fit into this? Yeah. So freelancer is self-employed and it's not a model

**Daniel Priestley:** that I think is a great model. So you're essentially chief cook and bottle washer. You're doing strategy and implementation and finance and scheduling and all of that sort of stuff. And essentially what you're doing is you're charging a premium because people don't have to commit to a long package. So what tends to work entrepreneurially is to not get caught up as a freelancer selling your own labor. All right, let's just zoom out a little bit. The school system teaches us to be component labor. So when we go to school, the whole thing is about everything is based off the industrial revolution model.

###  [Uncovering Deep Money Beliefs](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5b1ac7c8-ae8a-4b9c-8003-5dd296db3f01) 

🎧 37:52 - 39:49 (01:56)

The speaker revealed that carrying money brought up deep-seated issues about judgment, fear of attack, scarcity, and the feeling that his only value as a man is having money. This experience allowed him to process these beliefs and question their validity, triggering rapid introspection. Additionally, the speaker shared how his mentor advised him to avoid news, dismissing it as statistically irrelevant information.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Daniel Priestley:** several things happened it's surfaced up to it brought up to the surface all of the issues that i had around money so i'm going to be judged uh if i've got money people will judge me because i'm thinking what if somebody sees it what if they think I'm some sort of high roller or something? What if I'm paying for something and someone sees my money clip? And then it brought up, if you have money, people will attack you. So that was another psychology of money. It's like, you're going to be attacked for having money, physically harmed. And the other one was like, money's really hard to come by. It's a very scarce resource. And it's like, you know, getting it is really hard and you have to hold onto it. So all of this kind of bubbles up to the surface. And the other one was, what if a girl wants to date me because she thinks I've got lots of money, but I don't have money? So it was this whole idea of like my only value as a man is like my having money. So all of that is like bubbling. And then because it's bubbling up to the surface, you're able to think about it and process it and think, oh, is that the belief I want to have? Is that something I like thinking? So it was a trigger for dealing with money issues very rapidly. And mind you, $1,000 back in 2001 and 2002 was significantly more. If you want to do the activity today, you probably need a couple of thousand. There's inflation. In fact, it's going up 10% again. Yeah, so let at 10% that number. Sounds like a pretty cool mentor. He was great. Yeah. Did you have any other lessons that he taught you in a sort of somewhat weird manner? Well, I'll give you two. One was no news. So I was completely banned from the news. And he basically said, look, the news is just statistically irrelevant things that they present to you on a daily basis. They're not going to report to you that a plane landed

###  [The Power of No News and Lead Generation](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0a3b1004-c40f-4f02-b7f1-43185ac5b28e) 

🎧 39:23 - 40:49 (01:25)

The mentor emphasized the insignificance of news, stating that it only focuses on statistically irrelevant events and things beyond one's control, advocating for a complete blackout on news consumption. This approach was liberating, freeing up time, headspace, and negative emotions. Furthermore, the mentor emphasized the crucial role of lead generation, conveying that everything is downstream from it.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Daniel Priestley:** so let at 10% that number. Sounds like a pretty cool mentor. He was great. Yeah. Did you have any other lessons that he taught you in a sort of somewhat weird manner? Well, I'll give you two. One was no news. So I was completely banned from the news. And he basically said, look, the news is just statistically irrelevant things that they present to you on a daily basis. They're not going to report to you that a plane landed safely. They're not going to report to you that people woke up and went to work and had a lovely day. It's only going to be the statistically irrelevant things, the things that happened to one in 100,000 people. That's the only stuff that you're going to read in the news. The second thing about the news is none of it is anything you can do anything about. So you might think it's absolutely horrible what's happening in a particular place or a particular situation. That's not, you've got no ability to influence that. So get on with what you have the ability to do, build your own platform, build your own life, and then you might have the ability to influence more stuff. So one of his rules was a complete blackout on any form of news, newspapers, radio, television, just gone. And that is quite freeing as well, right? It frees up time, frees up headspace, frees up negative emotions. So that was great. And then the big lesson I got from John was everything is downstream from lead generation. So you

###  [Skillshare: A Platform for Diverse Learning](https://share.snipd.com/snip/56351a77-f181-42ab-8336-d4132dd02e70)

The platform also features classes on productivity, with three specific classes dedicated to this topic. Additionally, the speaker, who has been a teacher on Skillshare since 2019, emphasizes that Skillshare offers a one-month free trial and mentions that it is their go-to place for self-teaching. Furthermore, the speaker highlights the underlying reason for people's purchases, stating that all purchases are driven by a psychological tension between what individuals have and what they desire.

Your recent book, Scorecard Marketing, kind of talks about that very tactically. Anything else you'd recommend for helping someone learn the skill? So

**Daniel Priestley:** all of these skills relate to a broader set of skills, which is entrepreneurship. And some of the skills is understanding why people buy. So for example, all people buy things to relieve a psychological tension between what they have and what they want. So that is the underlying reason why anyone buys anything. There is some form of a psychological tension. Something's not right in the world. It should be this way, but it's currently this way,

###  [Understanding the Psychology of Buying](https://share.snipd.com/snip/05150120-66cb-4340-97b0-949bca682c01) 

🎧 44:54 - 46:16 (01:21)

Entrepreneurship skills encompass understanding why people buy, which is driven by a psychological tension between what they have and what they want. This tension fuels the buying process, and it can be dormant or actively sought. Every sale is triggered by a combination of emotion, logic, and urgency, and businesses need to be proficient in all three to be successful.

**Daniel Priestley:** all of these skills relate to a broader set of skills, which is entrepreneurship. And some of the skills is understanding why people buy. So for example, all people buy things to relieve a psychological tension between what they have and what they want. So that is the underlying reason why anyone buys anything. There is some form of a psychological tension. Something's not right in the world. It should be this way, but it's currently this way, and I want to close that gap. So that's the buying process. Now, sometimes people don't have much psychological tension around something, but it could be widened. Some people have a dormant psychological tension, which they're not consciously aware of, or they're not solution-seeking. They're just holding on to the problem and holding on to the frustration, but they're not in the process and you can spark a decision-making process. So the more you understand why people buy and what's going on under the surface and the fact that there are people actively looking for things and then there are people who are passively dealing with a frustrational problem but not actively searching. So getting a working understanding of these things is really powerful. The other thing that triggers every single sale is a combination of emotion, logic, and urgency. So some, and I've found that all businesses are only really naturally good at one.

###  [The Challenge of Sales and Marketing for Creators](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fb683712-292b-4fa1-8de9-3733a49563fd) 

🎧 49:17 - 50:27 (01:10)

Creators often struggle with the perception that sales and marketing are negative and pushy. This mindset stems from the discomfort of justifying and convincing people to value their creation, akin to 'selling your best friend to someone'. Creators wish for their work to be self-evidently valuable and for people to naturally appreciate it, but human nature requires a process of discovery and understanding before embracing something new.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Daniel Priestley:** that I used

**Ali Abdaal:** to have a hang up about and probably still do a little bit is that sales and marketing equals bad is evil it's like a bit icky it's a bit scammy and there was a lot of i think unlearning i had to do when selling our course for the first time two years ago now um and yeah is is this and and it's definitely a sentiment i've i've heard from a lot of people that, oh, I just hate the idea of sales. hate the idea of marketing. What's going on there? I totally agree.

**Daniel Priestley:** When you're a creator, when you're building something and you put your heart and soul into it, the idea that you have to then justify that and that you have to convince people to do it. It's kind of like, you know, weirdly like trying to sell your best friend to someone or like, you know, it's kind of like this weird thing that you want, you want it to be self evidently valuable. You want to be able to create something and people self evidently just know about it and love it and all of that. And that's just not how humans work, right? So humans have to go through a process of discovery we have to get to know something which is all about understanding the logic we

###  [Reflection on a Dark and Horrible Time](https://share.snipd.com/snip/761c3f9f-3a9b-4539-99f7-045214af737a) 

🎧 01:03:14 - 01:04:34 (01:20)

The speaker recalls a dark and horrible time characterized by slipping on ice in winter, nearly breaking their arm and hand, and receiving a bad phone call. This period led to reflection and rethinking their next steps. Additionally, the speaker describes an attempt to sell their business, which ended with the potential buyer having a heart attack on the day of exchange, resulting in a peculiar and challenging period.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Daniel Priestley:** Oh, it was great. Yeah, fantastic. I recommend it to everyone. It was dark and horrible. It was so dark and horrible. I remember in the middle of winter slipping on ice and almost breaking my arm And I remember a really bad phone call and hanging up and being on a reflex of just like anger, putting my fist out like that and banging it into a wall, a concrete wall, and like almost breaking my hand. And I almost had a almost broken hand and almost broken arm. And I'm like, what is going on? And yeah, it was a horrible time. But it was a time of reflection and it was time of thinking through what do I want to do next? And the other weird thing that happened at that time is I decided to try and sell the business. And I had this guy who agreed to buy the business for 300 grand, two payments of 150 grand. And I was like, oh, you know, at least I'll start again with something new, but I'll have 300 grand. anyway, on the day of exchange, he just doesn't show up. And it turns out he'd had a heart attack and went into hospital. And my acquirer had a heart attack. Yeah. So weird, like crazy weird time. How long did that period last?

###  [Reframing Disruption and Collaboration](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a02e9d2e-8418-4356-8ac3-d4085d5a4c38) 

🎧 01:10:08 - 01:11:21 (01:12)

In the industrial age, disruption is discouraged in schools but celebrated in the business world. Schools value individual effort, calling collaboration 'cheating', while in the real world, it is called having a high-functioning team. The schooling system focuses on producing labor components for big machines, which contrasts with the need for executives and smart collaborators in professional settings.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** It's like you're on the tractor

**Daniel Priestley:** plowing the field in a day, or you're one of a hundred people with a hand plow going, this is ridiculous. And it's this weird thing of like, well, why would I not do it? It's hard not to. So there's some things that you'll notice in the industrial age. So, for example, we teach kids that you should not be disruptive, right? The worst thing you can get on your report card is, you know, Ali is a disruptive person in the classroom. The best thing they can possibly call you on the front cover of Inc. magazine is disruptive, right? So, you know, there's a disconnect between these things. In school, putting together a team of smart kids who give you the answers is called cheating. In life, that's called having an executive team that is a really high functioning executive team. So if I, for me personally, if I have a great CFO who does all my maths homework for me, that's smart. That's a good thing to have. But in school, that would be the worst thing to do. So, you know, we're now this, and I mentioned it before, component labour is the name of the game in the schooling system. Your job is to become a useful component of labour to someone's big machine.

###  [The Curious Entrepreneur Wins](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2f052a43-7f25-4cdb-b90c-00f39251a6d7) 

🎧 01:12:58 - 01:14:46 (01:47)

The traditional education system focuses on speed to market and teamwork, rather than just academic achievement. Certain professions like medicine require certification, but the mindset in the entrepreneur revolution is about curiosity and exploration, where the most curious person, not the most qualified person, wins.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** She was like, oh, you'm

**Daniel Priestley:** thinking of starting a business. And then next time I saw him, he'd enrolled in an MBA for the certification. But I mean, imagine if in school, they said it's actually the first person to hand in their assignment, and it only has to be directionally correct. then it would be a very different environment it's like we're going to mark you based on speed to market like here's the assignment clock starts now whoever can hand in something that meets minimum standards and is directionally correct you're the one who does it and and extra points if you can pull together three or four people who all work together and you can get something there. Yeah. Yeah. I think on this point as well, like I've

**Ali Abdaal:** had similar conversations with friends and there seems to be a lot of resistance in the sense of, oh, but are you saying that a neurosurgeon doesn't need to be qualified? It's like, well, no, it's not.

**Daniel Priestley:** Definitely. Yeah. No, definitely. If you're component labor, you have to be certified. You have to, because you're a component, a cog in the machine and that cog has to be perfectly fit for the machine. There are certain professions, especially like medicine, that you've got to be qualified and perfectly machined within

**Ali Abdaal:** an inch. But I guess the danger is having that way of thinking, which then bleeds into anything else. And you think that suddenly someone has to give you permission to do a thing.

**Daniel Priestley:** As soon as you're in the entrepreneur revolution, you're adopting a very different mindset. It's a mindset of not knowing rather than knowing. So the most curious person wins, not the most qualified person. So if you said, oh, I'm going through a period of great curiosity, I know nothing and I'm trying to explore what people are frustrated by. That's

🎧 01:12:58 - 01:14:10 (01:11)

The speaker suggests that marking based on speed to market in school would create a different environment, where the first person to hand in an assignment, even if only directionally correct, would get the highest mark. They emphasize the value of collaboration and the ability to pull together a team to work on the assignment. However, they also assert that certain professions, like neurosurgery, require certification as they are component labor and need to be perfectly fit for the machine.

###  [Embrace the Mindset of Curiosity](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a8b803d6-884c-4013-af03-3060f6d5ab7e) 

🎧 01:14:29 - 01:16:07 (01:38)

In the world of entrepreneurship, embracing a mindset of not knowing, staying curious, and asking 'dumb' questions can be a winning approach. Successful entrepreneurs prioritize curiosity over qualifications and are unafraid to ask questions, even if they seem obvious, recognizing that humility and continuous learning are key to success in business. This mindset is in contrast to traditional roles where individuals may fear appearing incompetent and avoid asking questions for fear of being replaced.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Daniel Priestley:** As soon as you're in the entrepreneur revolution, you're adopting a very different mindset. It's a mindset of not knowing rather than knowing. So the most curious person wins, not the most qualified person. So if you said, oh, I'm going through a period of great curiosity, I know nothing and I'm trying to explore what people are frustrated by. That's probably the smarter position to take as an entrepreneur. Some of the best entrepreneurs, they love saying things like, talk to me like I'm a three-year I just don't understand. Sometimes they deeply understand, but they'll ask dumb questions because they're trying to stay curious. Steve Jobs' advice in his commencement speech was stay humble, stay curious.

**Ali Abdaal:** Yeah, that just sparks a thought. So again, when I was at university and kind of building this business and stuff, it was weird how often I'd be the one to put my hand up in a lecture and ask a question about something that was apparently obvious. But I just had this sort of complete non-fear of looking like an idiot. And a bunch of friends spoke to me afterwards. And even to this day, I it was like two weeks ago, I was chatting to some friends and they were like, yeah, I remember you would always ask these like dumb questions in lectures. And I'd be thinking the same thing, but I would be thinking I don't want to ask the question because I don't want to look dumb. I was like, well, and it was, I think, having done the entrepreneur thing and trying to make my web design business when I was 14 years old, all sort of entrenched in me this idea that it's totally reasonable to ask a dumb question. Yeah.

**Daniel Priestley:** If you're a component, if you're a cog in the machine, you don't want to reveal that there might be a crack in the cog, right? Because then they might replace you. So it's

###  [Invest in Your Future by Accepting a Pay Cut](https://share.snipd.com/snip/690a37d5-3bc5-4736-8bf7-f5c7434a6b8b) 

🎧 01:20:05 - 01:21:37 (01:32)

Having children can significantly impact the financial decisions one can make. While some individuals may be able to live frugally, the responsibility of providing for a family means that taking a pay cut is not always an option. However, it's important to consider the after-tax earnings and the hidden expenses associated with high-paying jobs. Sometimes, accepting a pay cut can be reframed as an investment in a side hustle or a startup, allowing individuals to build equity in their own business. This strategic approach can provide a long-term financial benefit and pave the way for future success.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Daniel Priestley:** Yeah. And I can understand that, especially, look, you're in a unique position in the sense that you don't have kids. Once you've got kids, then as much as you might personally, like for me personally, right, I can personally happily live mattress on the floor, you know, ramen noodles, whatever, right? That wouldn't bother me at all. But now I have kids. We have huge overheads, insane overheads every month, right? And I can't make decisions of like, oh, yeah, we'll all just live on mattresses on the floor. I might find myself divorced or something like that. So the key thing, or it wouldn't be fair to take them into that decision. So the key thing is there are certain people who can't take a pay cut. You've got to figure it out. So you've got to figure out, okay, what is my after-tax earnings? And sometimes a pay cut is not as savage as you think about it. If it's after-tax, you also might be spending a lot of money on commuting, or you might be spending a lot of money on things to keep up that particular role, which may not come with a boutique role. You also might have a boutique plus your side hustle venture money as a bit of a crossfade. Or you might view it as making an investment. So let's say you're taking a 10 grand pay cut. You're actually, the framing of it is I'm actually investing 10 grand into the creation of a startup. I'm willing to invest up to 30,000. So I'm willing to take this pay cut for three years as an investment into the equity that I own my own business.

###  [The Luxury of Work-Life Balance](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a9e99d04-0f7b-4032-8740-1d09d3fb04f3) 

🎧 01:22:32 - 01:23:40 (01:07)

Success in business often involves a long and grindy journey in the early days with less focus on work-life balance. As people get older and successful, they start to prioritize work-life balance. Work-life balance is considered a luxury belief that one can afford once they have achieved a certain level of wealth and success, particularly for individuals without dependents.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** we were kind of talking about steps steps to take we and we said maybe joining an entrepreneurial company might be a good a good sort of springboard um one thing that a lot of people talk about in who've had like success in business is how in the early days it was it was quite a lot quite a long slog quite a grindy like uh or like even though it was fun like work-life balance wasn't quite there and usually when people get older by the time i speak to them on the podcast they're a bit more like work-life balancey and chill and stuff and i'm always intrigued like does uh extent is it reasonable to want to have work-life balance while you're starting something versus once it's already successful and now you can chill? So

**Daniel Priestley:** it's quite a luxury belief, the idea of having work-life balance. It's something that you can afford to have if you've made... So once you hit a certain level of wealth and success, you can afford to pontificate about work-life balance. And if you're a single person who doesn't have any dependents, you can afford to think about work-life balance. The

###  [Division of Labor Drives Entrepreneurial Efficiency](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0a74d8e7-f3f2-4188-a997-9cbba99384b4) 

🎧 01:24:46 - 01:26:11 (01:25)

Optimizing time allocation for different business tasks allows for efficient division of labor and specialization, enabling a team to continue working on the business even when one member is on holiday. With a dedicated team, individuals can focus on specific roles, such as sales and marketing, leading to greater expertise and productivity in those areas. Work-life balance becomes achievable once the business has developed a dynamic team that specializes in their respective roles, akin to the Division of Labor concept from the industrial age.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Daniel Priestley:** it. If you were super optimized and gave each of those four things 15 hours a week, there's 60 hours, you know, and that's if you're doing part-time on each of those, like 15 hours a week is part-time sales, you know, 15 hours a week is part-time creating an asset. So when you get to work-life balances, when you have a team, if you have eight people working on a team and you take a holiday, seven out of eight are still working on the business. So it works. If you've got eight people on a team and you come up with an idea, you've got a group of people who can refine that idea, implement that idea, work on that idea and produce something. And you've probably got someone who's full-time sales and you've probably got someone who's full-time marketing. So now you've got a bit of team dynamic, team play. One of the great things to come out of the industrial age was something called division of labor, which is that if people just focus on one job and don't jump around, they make a lot more stuff. And that's true for any entrepreneurial business. A salesperson who's just focused on sales gets good at sales. And someone who's focused on editing videos gets good at editing videos. So if you try and get the video editor to make sales, they're going to suck at both. So work-life balance does tend to come later. I know that's unpopular to say. Everyone wants to be like, oh, no, peace, love, dove, Hare Krishna, as we can all just have a multi-million pound business in our spare time. But everyone

🎧 01:26:03 - 01:27:25 (01:21)

The concept of Worklife Balance often comes after experiencing burnout, and successful people have often sacrificed social events and personal time to achieve their goals. The path to success often involves consistently long working hours, including weekends, and a relentless focus on work every day without much time off for other activities.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Daniel Priestley:** say. Everyone wants to be like, oh, no, peace, love, dove, Hare Krishna, as we can all just have a multi-million pound business in our spare time. But everyone I know who's gone through that, even the people who talk about work-life balance, the way they came to work-life balance as a concept was by getting themselves completely burnt out. And then they, well, I'm reformed. Okay, great. You're reformed. Nice of you now you're a millionaire to be so reformed. Now you've got 55 people on your team behind the scenes. Yeah, fabulous. Now you can just do a strategic role. Well done. That's the end state. But what they're not being honest about is how they got there. And they got there normally by being out of balance they said no to a lot of stuff um you know they didn't go to the parties they um you know like for example when i did the 10 million year that like all of those five years working for john and then that that was 60 hours a week every week um we worked weekends we ran events on the weekend. We might've had one weekend off in a month. When I was starting my first business, it was roll out of bed, have breakfast. And as soon as I've finished breakfast, it's start work. And then it's work, work, work, work until dinner time and then finish dinner and then maybe do some more stuff after dinner and then go to bed. And that was every

###  [The Well-Worn Path to Entrepreneurial Success](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d681c8f8-0c2a-48bd-83b7-ac310ce29c4c) 

🎧 01:27:39 - 01:29:13 (01:34)

The most well-worn path to entrepreneurial success involves working for someone in the 20s, gaining experience and demonstrating value in the 30s, and then leveraging industry knowledge, contacts, and trust in the late 30s and early 40s. Successful entrepreneurs typically start a business at the age of 42 and sell it at 57, with very few regretting this hustle in their youth and instead feeling relieved that they made the leap before life became more complicated.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** The whole thing. In your experience, having spoken to a bunch of people who are successful in business, do many of them regret the way that they spent their youth in hustle mode? Or is it a lot of it was like, oh, I'm glad I'm chilled out now, but I kind of had to get through that phase and I don't regret putting in all that work back when I was young. Well,

**Daniel Priestley:** for starters, let's go to the data as well. Most people who start a business are 42. Most successful entrepreneurs are 42 when they start. So the most well-worn path is that you work for someone in your 20s and you do an apprenticeship. In your 30s, you start to get your stride and you start to make some inroads and you start to demonstrate value. You work up the chain a little bit. Towards your late 30s, early 40s, you start to figure out how this whole industry works and and got contacts, connections, you're trusted. And then at 42, you start a business that you then sell at 57, 15 years later, and make your millions. So that's the data, that's the path, right? So the path that most people take is career. And this is most successful, millionaire entrepreneurs started at 42, sold the business at 57. So regretting the, there are very few who actually super successful entrepreneurs who started in their 20s. I've not met many people who do regret that. I think a lot of people went, oh my goodness, thank goodness I jumped in with both feet when i had that when i didn't have the commitments because life gets more complicated not less complicated you know we end up you

###  [Market Needs Over Personal Wants](https://share.snipd.com/snip/23e957f4-ec9c-4d3f-9889-d80b97f4d7e5) 

🎧 01:31:21 - 01:32:47 (01:26)

When starting a business, it's crucial to prioritize market needs over personal desires, as the market does not care about individual needs or preferences. Entrepreneurship is about serving the market and solving its problems in a scalable way, ultimately creating jobs for others. The focus should be on determining whether there is a demand for the product or service and being willing and able to meet that demand, while understanding that as the business grows, the difficult problems will be the entrepreneur's responsibility.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Daniel Priestley:** right to not take that lightly. That's an important decision to make. You need to really get good signals from the market that the market wants this thing that you have. So once again, wanting to have a side hustle, wanting to have this is all about your own personal needs, which are irrelevant to the market. The market does not care, right? Like if I go and buy a kebab at three o'clock in the morning, do I ever ask the kebab shop owner, are you okay? Are you managing your work-life balance enough? Why are you out here at three o'clock in the morning? You know, is your family seeing enough of you? I'm not asking anything like that. I'm just paying my four pounds for my kebab at three o'clock in the morning. I have no care. The market does not care about your work-life balance, doesn't care about how healthy or happy you are. It just cares whether you're meeting its needs. So the starting point for any business, first principles is not, what do you want? It's like, does the market want something? And are you, are you willing and able to, to make that work for the marketplace? But you can't be too self-centered here. Entrepreneurship is an act of service. It is a gift to the world. You're creating something that's going to solve problems for others in a scalable way. You're going to create jobs for others. As you get bigger and bigger, all the hard problems are going to roll up to your entrepreneurial desk. All the easy stuff will be solved by the people that you hire and only the tricky stuff gets to you.

###  [The Power of Online Scorecards](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d1960e75-4a4f-40d6-a2f4-2420565ae510) 

🎧 01:36:16 - 01:37:23 (01:06)

Creating online scorecards can be a powerful tool for engaging an audience and generating sales. By leveraging a scorecard in an accelerator program, the speaker attracted 90,000 participants and earned 15 million pounds in sales. Despite being essentially a glorified online quiz, the scorecard provided valuable insights and drove addictive self-improvement behavior in the participants. Even top executives found the scorecards insightful and motivating, highlighting the effectiveness and appeal of this approach.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** And I guess you can just start by making one of these things on like some free software and chucking it on your Facebook friends list or messaging your friends on Instagram. Someone created that software. Yeah. So what is a scorecard? What's the deal

**Daniel Priestley:** with that? So when I launched the Key Person of Influence Accelerator, we created the Key Person of Influence scorecard and this became a massive thing. 90,000 people took it and we made 15 million pounds off the back end of sales. And it's just like a glorified online quiz. It's a glorified online quiz, right? It's like a personality test. It essentially, in the book, it says, are you any good at pitching? Are you any good at creating products? And the scorecard asks you a series of questions and it gives you a score. And it says you're a four out of 10 for pitching.

**Ali Abdaal:** There's addictive about that. I signed up with a CEO coach like three days ago. He had two scorecards that he made me take, and I was like, damn, I've got a lot of improvement. Yeah,

**Daniel Priestley:** right. Take my money. Because it's like if I ask you 50 questions, and each question gives you a little bit of psychological tension, and then it adds up, and then your score comes out at 43%. And you being you, you're like, oh, I've got to optimize right

###  [Testing Lead Generation for Business Ideas](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a14ceafb-1f1f-4093-b3bc-dcb2dc9a1c40) 

🎧 01:42:03 - 01:43:32 (01:29)

Running events and launching scorecards can serve as lead generation and minimum viable products (MVPs) for testing business ideas. By tracking the growth of event attendance or scorecard usage over a few months, it becomes clear whether the business idea has potential. Ultimately, lead generation is the crucial factor to test first, as it determines the success of the idea regardless of other factors such as product quality or public speaking ability. Any signal of interest from potential customers, such as purchasing a ticket, counts as a lead and an indication of potential success.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Daniel Priestley:** I do. Yeah. or at end. Same thing if you run an event. So as I said, my whole first empire was intro events, introduction events, and that was the lead generation and warm-up phase in one. And then scorecards became the digital version of that, always available 24-7, collecting data, making recommendations on autopilot. So those are all lead generations, but they're also good MVPs. So anyone who's got an idea, run an event, see if you can fill it, launch a scorecard, see if you can get people taking it. And that'll tell whether you're going to be any good or not, or whether you've got any chance to do this. Do it for maybe four months in a row and see whether you can grow it each month. Because if you get 30, then 20, then 10, then five, then we're tracking in the wrong direction. If you get 30, then 50, then 100, then 150, okay, maybe this could take off. So you want a very simple MVP. It's just lead generation at first. So all you're trying to do is, can I generate leads? Because everything is downstream from lead generation. So can I generate leads? If you can't generate leads, forget about how good you are as a doctor, forget about how amazing your product is, forget about how well you can do it speaking, right? All of that doesn't matter if you can't get the lead. So ultimately, the first thing to test is lead generation. Can I generate leads for this idea? So what counts as a lead? Any signal of interest, where essentially they're giving you some revealing signal of interest. So buying a ticket is a reveal.

###  [Understanding Product-Market Fit](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f4b4866e-89c3-43d1-bbca-e3c055915d8e) 

🎧 01:44:55 - 01:46:37 (01:42)

The speaker shares an experience of unintentionally discovering product-market fit for their Youtuber course. Initially planning to target YouTubers with 100,000 subscribers, they found that 95% of the survey respondents hadn't even made their first video, and the remaining 5% had less than 100 subscribers. This led them to realize that their course was more suitable for complete beginners who lacked time to dedicate to YouTube. They also learned that product-market fit can be baffling, as the values of the seller may differ from those of the buyer, and understanding and catering to the buyer's values is crucial for success.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Daniel Priestley:** wants so

**Ali Abdaal:** we i think i accidentally did this well it wasn't quite accidentally we were we when when launching the first iteration iteration of our youtuber course two years ago we worked with this marketing coach and he was like okay send an email to your list being like, what is your biggest challenge with growing your YouTube channel? And see what happens. And then on the second page of that, ask them a few sort of more qualifying, a few more questions. And initially I was imagining our YouTuber course would be helping people from a hundred thousand subscribers scale up by building systems and processes and stuff. It out 95% of the people who filled out the survey hadn't even made their first video. And like the other 5%, like we're all under a hundred subscribers and we were like, what the hell? Like, this is not what we had in mind. This is more like a YouTube for complete and utter beginners who have a job, but like, we don't feel like they have the time to do YouTube properly and want to just learn all the, oh, that's a very different product to here is how you can hire and outsource a team and build systems and stuff to blow up your business. No, it's like your

**Daniel Priestley:** market. They're like, we want to get started. And they almost always would say, what equipment do you have? And you might've gone, oh, well, it doesn't matter. Just with your phone.

**Ali Abdaal:** But like people love the equipment thing.

**Daniel Priestley:** want the equipment thing.

**Ali Abdaal:** And people love templates. People love the whole like, oh, what's the template you use for your videos? It's like, I mean, it's not that hard. It's just these three things, but okay, let's package it up as a now people love it. They're like, oh my God, thank you so much for the template. It's so useful. And I'm always a bit baffled, but now I've kind of learned over time. product market fit. And

**Daniel Priestley:** product market fit is often baffling because your values are different to the values of someone who's buying the product. Because if you're a fitness trainer, you've got fitness high on your values and you research it all the time, you read it all the time. If you're a fitness trainer buyer, you're buying a product like that. Fitness is low on your values, which is why you're buying. So you

🎧 01:58:54 - 02:00:12 (01:17)

The go-to-market activities of a startup involve joint ventures, promotions, hustling, making sales, and potentially hiring a team or salesperson. Testing revenue may come from customer deposits or upfront payments for a hands-on setup, even before the full product is developed. Many successful startups start with manual processes, like using Google Sheets, before building the software.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Daniel Priestley:** You might do joint ventures and promotions. You're hustling. You're making sales. You might hire a team at that point. You might hire a salesperson. So that's all the go toto-market activity. You're probably going from testing revenue. Maybe you've earned 50 grand testing and now you're going to earn 500,000 or a million. Where did the testing revenue come in? Well, you might've had people put down deposits or you might've just taken on, like, let's say, well, for example, when we built ScoreApp, I did like a dozen people who paid eight grand each for their scorecard and we built it on WordPress. And we literally just charged them the full amount to build it from scratch each time. And that's because there was no platform. That's how much it cost. So we probably earned 80 to 100 grand worth of people paying for a setup. But it was a hands-on setup.

**Ali Abdaal:** Yeah.

**Daniel Priestley:** Yeah. It seems like a lot of startups do this where you

**Ali Abdaal:** sign up to the thing, but in the early days, it's someone on a Google sheet who's like doing the thing. And they know they're going to build the software at some point, but at least they've got someone on a Google sheet doing the thing.

**Daniel Priestley:** That is the most successful startups. Yeah. That's how it's done. That's how the professionals do it, by the way. A lot of the time, the amateurs think that the professionals go and build this amazing all singing, all dancing thing and then sell it. That's

🎧 02:00:58 - 02:02:01 (01:02)

Online personal trainers often use standardized templates for their clients' programming, but clients value the support and accountability provided. However, this model is similar to self-employed freelancing, where the focus is on selling labor rather than building an asset. In contrast, entrepreneurs focus on building scalable solutions and businesses that have value as assets, which can be sold in the future.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** yeah i think uh so uh personal trainers who do like online personal training and stuff. I feel like there's this thing where it's like, they're going to give you the programming or something like that. But it's probably just like a Google Sheet template that they just use for all their clients. And maybe at some point, there's like a sophisticated level of like, customization. But realistically, everyone broadly needs the same plan so yeah

**Daniel Priestley:** yeah yeah and a lot of the time people want hand-holding they want support they want accountability um so what they're providing is those those types of things but once again that is a self-employed freelancer type model uh so it's not so much like what we're discussing is that world of the entrepreneur building the scalable solution and building a business that will eventually have value. Because an entrepreneur builds an asset. And the reason entrepreneurs can sell their business is they have an asset and the asset's saleable. And that's the difference. Self-employed people aren't really building an asset. They're selling labor.

The speaker's infinite game is to develop entrepreneurs who stand out, scale up, and make a positive impact. This is done through accelerator programs that focus on developing entrepreneurs with purpose at the heart of their business. The speaker has worked with 3,500 companies worldwide and has also developed a technology, Score app, to solve the lead generation problem. The speaker also provides coaching to individuals who could be key influencers in changing the world, emphasizing the importance of using one's skills and expertise in entrepreneurship for making a difference.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Daniel Priestley:** more of well, my infinite game is to develop entrepreneurs who stand out, scale up and make a positive impact. That's my infinite game. So

**Ali Abdaal:** I

**Daniel Priestley:** do that through my accelerator programs. We develop entrepreneurs who stand out, scale up and have purpose at the heart of their business. And we've done that with three and a half thousand companies around the world now. Score app is a piece of technology that solves the number one problem that people have, which is the lead generation problem. So it allows them to stand out, scale up and start making a difference. And on my accelerators, I often put heads of social charities and change projects and put them through. And we like, I do one-to coaching with people who could be a key person of influence in a way that really changes the world. So yeah, look, I have a bunch of fun because if you have a set of skills, you want to use those skills. It feels right that you've drawn to use those skills because it's like, you know i'm you know if you like if you're a ballroom dancer and you're really good at dancing you want to dance um if you're a guitarist and you're really good at guitar you want to pick up the guitar and play so if you're an if you're an entrepreneur and you start figuring out how this crazy world of entrepreneurship actually works yeah you want to talk about it you want to do it you want to buy and sell stuff you want to scale Yeah.

**Ali Abdaal:** One of my coaches asked a few weeks ago, he asked me, you know, the thought experiment of what would life look like if I wasn't, if I would have just was not allowed to create anything on the internet for the next like two years. And I was like, okay, I mean, fair enough. I guess I do loads of reading, get into philosophy and economics and politics.

🎧 02:17:42 - 02:19:18 (01:36)

The thought experiment of not being able to create anything on the internet leads to a realization that the infinite game for some people is teaching and learning new things. The risk lies in overusing one's strengths, such as being picky about life choices due to experiencing fun, freedom, and flexibility. This can result in reluctance to settle down and have a family, as seen in the example of Tim Ferriss.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Daniel Priestley:** Yeah.

**Ali Abdaal:** One of my coaches asked a few weeks ago, he asked me, you know, the thought experiment of what would life look like if I wasn't, if I would have just was not allowed to create anything on the internet for the next like two years. And I was like, okay, I mean, fair enough. I guess I do loads of reading, get into philosophy and economics and politics. I'm interested in reading all that kind of stuff. And then when the two-year market is up, then I can distill all that stuff. And that would be super fun. And then he was like, okay, what if you're not allowed to do anything on the internet, any kind of teaching on the internet for the rest of your life? I was like, oh damn, I'd be really depressed. I guess I'd, I don't know, try and do it in like teaching in real life and host lectures and stuff. But that made me realize that for me, the infinite game is teaching, like learning cool stuff and teaching it learning

**Daniel Priestley:** how life works sharing it with others and helping improve their lives right so that's who you are and that's that speaks to your identity and and all of that the risk can be that your strong suit can become um overused you can be a ballerina who dances until your feet bleed um So one thing that is a risk is when you discover how great life can be with fun, freedom, and flexibility built in, you often become very picky about your partner who you're going to settle down with and have kids with and all that sort of stuff. So therefore, you get a lot of people like Tim Ferriss, bless him, but he's notoriously single and footloose, fancy free and not having kids and all that sort of stuff, which is, I get it. It's kind of cool. I was that guy, right? But
