###  [Prioritize Learning Coding Skills for Making Money Online](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2f618f35-9ae9-47c2-9115-31354b041b24) 

🎧 15:41 - 17:08 (01:26)

Learning how to code is emphasized as an essential step for making money on the internet due to its higher expected value compared to creating content like gaming YouTube videos. The speaker recommends investing time in learning coding, highlighting its potential payoffs in various aspects of life. The importance of prioritizing this skill is underscored by the speaker's personal example of procrastinating learning a new editing software despite its potential benefits for business. Ultimately, the speaker suggests that the level of desire and commitment to acquiring coding skills is a determining factor in achieving success in making money online.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** still get emails every day from people being like, how do I money on the internet? And it's so hard to say anything other than like, look, learning how to code is a really, really good first step. There are a lot of people that try to go down the creator route. And sure, that's fine. But I think the expected value of learning how to code is just way bigger, way, way. The payoff for everything in your life is just way higher than let me try and make some gaming YouTube videos, which is an area that a lot of people try and go down and competing with like a zillion other people doing the same thing. Even

**Cliff Weitzman:** being a creator, I'll give you an example. Like I was a kid, I used to make parkour videos for YouTube all the time. So I got really good at iMovie and you know, some other editing software, but I don't use TikTok that much as a consumer, but I want to make TikTok videos because I think that it would be a great advertisement for Speechify. And so I don't want to use TikTok on my phone, but CapCut is an amazing editing software for TikTok. I haven't learned how to use CapCut yet. And I've had it on my phone for at least a month. And I'm actually genuinely frustrated at myself that I haven't taken the time sit down for an hour and just learn how to use CapCut. So that's probably going to happen in the next month. And here's when you know that I'm finally going to sit down and sacrifice not talking to the team, not hiring more people, not spending more on ads, whatever, not learning something new that I haven't. It's when I wanted enough. enough. And this is coming from a person who is literally dyslexic. My first language is not English. I do not have a high aptitude for programming to begin with. You

###  [Upgrade Your Brain Software](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1ef73393-d556-4327-90ee-8f82f4fae692) 

🎧 17:43 - 19:19 (01:35)

Computer science provides a diverse tool set for thinking and decision-making. The concepts learned, such as diminishing marginal returns and PPF curve shifts, shape the brain's daily operations, enabling better explanatory capabilities. Data structures and algorithms from computer science equip individuals to process more information and make superior decisions. Upgrading the brain's 'software' through learning new methods of thinking can enhance problem-solving skills and resilience, complementing traditional intelligence measures like IQ and emotional intelligence. Investing even a few hours in studying computer science basics can significantly benefit individuals in making sound decisions.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Cliff Weitzman:** is just incredible because it has so many tool sets for how to think. So when I was in high school, I was really interested in economics, right? Keynesian economics, Hayek, Mises, Malthus. I read so many books about it and I read so many books, listened to so many books about philosophy and business and theology and all this kind of stuff. They taught me things like Giffen goods, right? Diminishing marginal returns. What happens when the PPF curve shifts to the right? All this stuff is key to how my brain just operates on a daily basis. And it lets me explain things in my head to myself that otherwise I would not be able to explain. Computer science gave me like an equal amount of data structures and algorithms for how to think. And that is key for making better decisions and being able to use more information. So if you want to think about your brain as a machine, right, it has a certain amount of processing power. And so you can either upgrade the hardware or you can upgrade the software. So I'd say that I have an okay brain, right? The where I, you know, the people have, you know, IQ, intelligent quotients, EQ, emotional intelligence, AQ, adversity quotient. The place where I break the scale is adversity quotient. I like never give up in places where other people would. My IQ is good. It's not great. I would argue, but you can upgrade your software. So that's one way of upgrading the software of your brain. It just teaches you new methods of thinking. So anyone who needs to make decisions on a regular basis, highly recommend at least spending 20, 30 hours studying the basics of computer science. Fantastic. This episode

###  [Innovative Entrepreneurial Mindset](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ba52b5b1-c0da-4e6a-a20c-0ab94ea92a62) 

🎧 21:51 - 23:13 (01:21)

Understanding financial concepts early on, realizing the importance of having a source of income for freedom, and being inspired by 'The 4-Hour Workweek' led to the goal of building a lucrative business. The focus on creating value and inventing new things as an entrepreneur is highlighted, with a deep-rooted passion for inventing and transforming resources into something valuable.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Cliff Weitzman:** I think I got a very deep understanding of how the financial world operates as a kid. And I realized very quickly that if I wanted to have freedom, it's good to have a source of income. And then I read The 4-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss, I think when I was 17 or 18. And I was like, wow, I would love to build a muse company. So my goal is I'm going to build something that makes me 300k a year, whether I work or not. And so I was working towards succeeding in doing that. And I started building stuff even before I read that book. But that book, again, gave me a bunch of mental models of how to think about it that were very useful. And so all that stuff inspired me to make stuff. And then naturally, I'd MacGyver things with bicycles when I was a kid. I always liked Mickey Tinkering. And I think that even more than an entrepreneur, I am an inventor. I love inventing things. And the word entrepreneurship actually comes from a Latin root, meaning to elevate economic resources from an area of low yield to an area of high yield. Effectively, you're creating value where there was none before. And if you think about, Emerson has a great essay about this called On Wealth. The person who made the steam engine, right, there was a bunch of like scrap metal, Thomas Avery, in his garage or whatever workshop. And he applied his thought to matter, rearrange atoms in a certain way, and then elevated those resources and multiply and then times thousands and a million. And now

###  [Building Skills Through Networking and Persistence](https://share.snipd.com/snip/febb30db-18d3-4193-afcd-b708d4740f19) 

🎧 26:19 - 27:41 (01:22)

The speaker shares their experience of learning about advertising and creating content by observing others, networking with key individuals such as Amara, Logan, Valentin, Eric, and Mr. Beast, and studying the top 100 best performing ads. Through perseverance and dedication, the speaker mastered ad creation like coding, showcasing the importance of networking, skill-building, and persistence in achieving success.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Cliff Weitzman:** in some cases, I would literally go into the office, sit behind them and saw how they bought ads. And then I would go in to do the same thing. And then I wanted to get good at creating content. So, um, you know, someone had happened to introduce me to Amar from Yes Theory at a certain point when I was living in LA. And this was before I got really into ads. And Amar and I became like instant best friends, right? We started going on a lot of adventures together. We were like very similar people. And then Amar introduced me to Logan. And then Logan and I started doing a bunch of adventures together. And he helped me shoot one of my ads. And then we met through Valentin. And then I met Eric because he was a big user of Speechify. And then Eric introduced me to Mr. Beast. And then I went and I slept in Jimmy's house for a week and saw how James operates and Tyler and the entire production team. And at a certain point, what I did is I made a list of the top a hundred best performing ads in history. And I literally sat in my house in LA and I remade all the ads and someone that did really well and someone that did bad. Um, same thing as coding. I just put in the time for it. Um, and that's it down. Okay.

**Ali Abdaal:** So someone listened to this is like, so the I've, I've, I've of heard bits of your story before and we've, we, we've, talked a bunch of times and I'm always just absolutely floored by just a, the, the tenacity and just the going overboard that you do on everything. Yeah. And be just like how casually you talk about it. You're like, oh yeah, you know, I wanted to learn about ads. So

###  [Authenticity in Cold Emails](https://share.snipd.com/snip/641eab2b-693a-4c31-bbb3-02a130aebe2c) 

🎧 30:57 - 32:17 (01:20)

The cold email demonstrates genuine admiration for the recipient, showcases the sender's credibility and achievements, and conveys a personal connection by referring to specific podcast episodes. The sender expresses interest in starting a podcast, reveals a desire to interview a specific individual, and suggests possible meeting times, while emphasizing their accomplishments to establish credibility and show dedication.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Cliff Weitzman:** what's the last cold email that i sent um let's say i'm messaging you sure be like hey ali just watch your podcast on Brandon Sanderson. Kaladin is my favorite character I've ever read about period. I really admire the way in which you interview your guests. I think you're extremely, um, thoughtful and well-researched. I'm considering starting a podcast. So far, I've interviewed the president of the World Bank and seven Teal fellows. The person I most want to interview is Derek Sivers. Could you be free for a 10-minute Zoom call Friday at 3 p.m. or 4 p.m. or Saturday at this time or this time? My best, Cliff. P.S., before this, I won Harvard's Hackathon, Stanford's Hackathon, and MIT's Hackathon, and I'm studying renewable energy engineering at Brown. Cliff. So that email shows that I actually follow you. It shows what I admire about you genuinely. It's relatively short. It still shows that I have credibility in what I'm doing towards it. And when you read the email, you're like, okay, he's not like just some kid on the internet. Like he's working hard. And if

###  [Demonstrate Credibility and Accomplishments](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9e551cd6-e947-490a-855e-241537b2f767) 

🎧 32:05 - 33:20 (01:15)

By showcasing your accomplishments and hard work in a well-composed message, you demonstrate credibility and dedication. This can make a significant impact on how you are perceived and increase the chances of a positive response. People appreciate when you highlight your achievements and the effort you put into your work, which can lead to valuable connections and opportunities.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Cliff Weitzman:** shows what I admire about you genuinely. It's relatively short. It still shows that I have credibility in what I'm doing towards it. And when you read the email, you're like, okay, he's not like just some kid on the internet. Like he's working hard. And if I didn't have those accomplishments, I would say the same things I would say at high school. Hey Ali, my name is Cliff Weitzman. I'm a junior at Redwood High School. I'm the president of the speech and debate team. I recently won the state competition for Sparta debate. I'm the president of the Jefferson Awards Community Service Club. And you changed my life. You are the person who made me learn how edit videos. And I have now made 300 YouTube videos. You know, I only have 500 subscribers, but I want to be like you when I grew up. Would you be free for a three minute for like a 15 minute call at this time at this time? If not, here's my two questions. And if you just send a message that is well composed, where you show that you've done work, here's the thing that people love. And I was just talking to my brother about this. We have a friend, Nima Barty, who's the CEO of Atlas. I love talking to Nima about his business. He's worked on it for maybe two years. I give the kid, I give Nima an inch, he takes a mile.

###  [Focus on Fast Learners with Passion for the Product](https://share.snipd.com/snip/19df0d44-4ef8-4bc3-9e5e-745cc312b16f) 

🎧 50:42 - 51:59 (01:16)

The speaker mentions the importance of fast learners with passion for the product, loyalty to the team, and the ability to ship features quickly and impact metrics, regardless of their educational or professional background. They emphasize hiring based on these qualities over prestigious schools or previous workplace experiences. The core philosophy at the speaker's company, Speechify, involves extreme product quality, user satisfaction, and prioritizing speed in development and delivery.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** yes, sometimes no, like small amounts. Yeah. Because I guess like if someone is thinking of starting a company, it's like, because it sounds like you were semi bootstrapped and that you're just kind of hacking away this app yourself. Yeah. And then you get a few users through the gate who are paying you the $140 a year for it. And then you're using that money to hire more people. Yeah. But that feels like it would be a hard thing because my understanding is that in tech, salaries pretty high. And so how could you possibly afford? Great question.

**Cliff Weitzman:** Simon, I'm not going to tell you how much he was paid, but he was paid almost nothing. And I was hiring people in Ukraine to work for us. This is part of why the Apple Snapchat people didn't work out. Their salaries were just unrealistic. And a lot of people were like interns who were university students and people who didn't make school with me and often people who were in high school. To this day, I have this philosophy that I don't care what your pedigree is. I don't care if you went to Brown or Harvard or Stanford. I care if you worked at Facebook or Google. I care that you learn fast. You have fire in the belly for the product, high loyalty to the team, and you're able to ship features fast and move metrics. And that's all I care about. And the core philosophy at Speedify is extreme product quality and user obsession, leading with love, we talked about Kaladin, frugality and speed. That's all we care about.

###  [Skill Over Age](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fd9c6628-19ad-4dd8-84cf-8ae230ae00fe) 

🎧 52:14 - 53:40 (01:26)

Success is not limited by age. High schoolers with the right skills can make significant contributions to a business. A teenager, Jan, optimized keywords for TikTok, built a 250,000 following, and hired 200 micro influencers for the company. Age or academic accomplishments do not always dictate success, as evidenced by the speaker's brother, Tyler, who was more successful despite being younger and achieving financial independence in high school.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Cliff Weitzman:** And we have multiple high schoolers who are working at Speechify because they're great. Like Jan was in Uruguay. He was 16. And he found the app and he emailed me incessantly. He sent so many messages. And he sent me like a 10 page report on how to optimize our keywords for TikTok. And he had built a TikTok following at 250,000 people. And eventually I was like, great, boom, here's a credit card, like go hire micro influencers to help us make ads. And he hired 200 people who would make us ads. And so we fed that into three creative producers who would then make 100 ads a week that we would test on the different platforms. And so, yeah, I just don't care how old someone is or if you're good at your... Nice. So what year are we? So I graduated from Brown in 2016. 2017, I was a visiting scholar at brown yeah um in the beginning of the year by march of that year i had moved to san francisco yeah and um a couple months later simon moved from uh birmingham slash bulgaria to san francisco i

**Ali Abdaal:** like at this point like how much revenue is coming into the business if you don't mind sharing?

**Cliff Weitzman:** Again, we talked about this right before I got here. My brother Tyler was a lot more successful than me at this point in time. He had gone to Stanford, was the president of his fraternity, had made enough money in high school to pay for Stanford,

###  [Consistent Exercise and Diet for Physical Transformation](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fbbf4aa8-ac99-46ba-af4d-ca23d9c9342f) 

🎧 02:07:54 - 02:09:10 (01:15)

Consistency in exercising triceps, biceps, and bench press, along with using wrist straps and incorporating stretches is key to developing muscle mass. The speaker suggests doing specific exercises and tracking progress with a Google sheet to reach desired weight goals. By focusing on regular workouts and a proper diet, achieving physical transformation is attainable through bulking and cutting cycles.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Cliff Weitzman:** don't need an attachment at all. Just like grab the calabiner and bend and do a 90 degree with your elbow to the back and just stretch it and do 12 of them on each side and do it like five times. And then do the same thing. I really like getting wrist straps for your wrist. You can order them on Amazon. And then curls, one arm at a time. And you'll get huge arms. If you do the triceps and the biceps and then you do bench press. And if you can get to like 200 pounds bench press, you're like in a great place. And that's it. And so it's exactly like the people who told you like stretch every day for 30 days, just like you can literally do the math on a Google sheet of when you will get to the amount of weight that you want. If you exercise and you eat right. And that's all you need. Fantastic. And if you go to my Instagram, at Cliff Weitzman, C-L there's a detailed Instagram post where you see where I was 167 pounds at like 11% body fat compared to like where I started. And then now I'm more than that now. I'm like 185, 190. And so yeah, you can like bulk and then you can cut. You can bulk and then you can cut. That's it.

###  [Impacts on Happiness and Success](https://share.snipd.com/snip/00941019-dbde-4e92-8a4c-35f0d8ccb4ee) 

🎧 02:14:50 - 02:16:11 (01:21)

Life events like accidents and marriage can have significant impacts on happiness levels, with happiness either decreasing or increasing and stabilizing at a certain level. Access to good healthcare and food is essential and sometimes spending money on these is beneficial despite initial reluctance. Delegating tasks like payroll and accounting can lead to a better quality of life. Success should not solely be defined by financial measures, as those who do often lack happiness.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Cliff Weitzman:** then asymptotes back to exactly where it was, sometimes lower. People who are in grave accidents and get maimed, it decreases by a lot and then asymptotes back to where it was. People who get married, their happiness increases by 10% and stays there. People who get divorced, their happiness decreases by 20% and stays there. So actually marriage is a risk. I think that having access to good healthcare, access to good food, I don't look at the price when I book Ubers and when I buy food, specifically protein and healthy food because I had a lot of problems with this because I moved to San Francisco and I just wouldn't eat. And I would bike places and miss events and make less friends because I wasn't allowing myself to travel. And so I decided it's worthwhile not to look at the price because really it's hard for me to spend money. One great thing is Pankaj on our team leads finance and I used to pay all the salaries and I love paying people. Um, but it also feels bad like having money leave the bank account. So I now don't do the payroll, uh, big improvement in my quality of life. Same thing for having out someone else doing the accounting. Um, And the goal is exactly what you talked about before, which is how do you define success? And it should not be financial. If you look at all the people around you who measure success by money, they're not happy.

###  [Defining Success beyond Financial Metrics](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a0792092-36eb-4a6e-bf59-7632d4209ec9) 

🎧 02:15:56 - 02:17:27 (01:30)

Success should not be defined by financial metrics. Happiness is found in long-term committed relationships, good health, continuous learning and growth, contribution to the world, open-mindedness, childlike wonder, and curiosity. It is important to consider factors like family size, home, vacations, and lifestyle costs to determine the amount of money needed for a fulfilling life.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Cliff Weitzman:** And the goal is exactly what you talked about before, which is how do you define success? And it should not be financial. If you look at all the people around you who measure success by money, they're not happy. By the way, I was recently at an event where there was like Elon Musk was there, like the CEOs of like 30 of the top 500 companies in the world were there. You know, a bunch of authors that we know and love. The people who were the happiest, one was Saul Kahn from Kahn Academy, who I really admire. And by and large, it's people who have been in long-term committed relationships and people who take really good care of their health. I think that those are the things that I saw have the highest correlation human thriving. And then you just got to make sure that you're actively learning and growing and ideally contributing to the world. And keep an open mind and have childlike wonder and curiosity. And so just think about money as, literally this is like the best exercise to do from the four-hour work week sit down write down what you want in your life do you want three kids five kids seven kids uh where do you want to have a house how many times a year do you want to take vacations and how much will those vacations cost you know how much money do you want to spend on clothes do you want one car two car three car what type of car do the math for how much money you need Cool. Great. So I did that. I

###  [Success is Measured by Relationship Investments](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6b693d45-211c-448b-9c43-8077f4ca392b) 

🎧 02:21:41 - 02:23:06 (01:25)

Thriving and happiness come from growth, learning, new experiences, and stepping outside of comfort zones. Building lasting relationships and expressing love through conversations is vital for success. Success is defined by the number of 'I love you' conversations had with loved ones. Regularly checking in and expressing love to family, friends, and team members is essential. Improving the quality of life of loved ones by solving their financial stress brings happiness and security.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Cliff Weitzman:** took a long while to reproduce that college experience in real life. I find that for me, I feel the most thriving when I am growing, when I am learning, when I'm in new experiences, when I'm pushed outside my comfort zone. That's what makes me happy. That and building new and lasting relationships and investing in relationships with people that I love. Tim Ferriss is a great line. Your success in life can be measured by the number of difficult conversations you're willing to have. The version of that that I have is your success in life can be measured by the number of conversations you finish with I love you. That's a lot, in my opinion, more important because that's how I define success. And so I call people who I love all the time and I check in on them, right? Today I messaged probably like five, six different people. Hey man, just wanted to check in. How's it going? Love you.
