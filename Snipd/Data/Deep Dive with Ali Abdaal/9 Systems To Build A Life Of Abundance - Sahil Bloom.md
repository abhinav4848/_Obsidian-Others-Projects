###  [The Importance of Systemizing to Overcome Natural Biases](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ab2eea08-9ed2-4ea2-bfcb-9d86d1ab2954) 

🎧 10:45 - 12:05 (01:20)

Systemizing workouts and daily tasks helps to achieve results as spontaneous activities may not lead anywhere. Human beings tend to have a natural bias towards the easiest tasks, and this calls for the need to create systems to avoid succumbing to this bias. By pre-planning tasks and systematizing activities, one can overcome the tendency to choose easier, unproductive tasks. The approach of pre-planning tasks and creating systems is essential to fight natural tendencies and achieve productive outcomes.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** think it's sort of like, yeah, this, like, for example, systemizing workouts, if you have a list of the exercises you're going to do, I'm going to do these exercises three times a week, and I'm just going to follow the plan. That's systemizing your health in a way that really leads to results. Whereas the alternative thing of like spontaneous spontaneity, when I go to the gym, is not really going to get anyone anywhere, unless, of course, they want to be the person that just goes for a run when they go to the gym or whatever they might look.

**Sahil Bloom:** I mean, your natural bias as a human being is to do the easiest thing. Like our natural bias is towards slothdom. I always say that about myself for sure. I consider myself an extremely disciplined and hardworking person. But my natural bias is still to be a sloth. Like if I wake up in the morning, and I don't know what my first task is going to be of the day, I end up doing the easiest, dumbest task that doesn't actually drive anything forward. So what I had to do to systematize and make sure that that doesn't happen is the night before, I decide what I'm going to do the next morning, and I get it set up. Like if I need to work on a particularly challenging section of my book, I'm going to open up that section. And I'm going to be zoomed in on that section so that when I get to my desk and open it up, that's the only choice that I have. It's sitting right there. And that's just like you're creating systems so that things get a little bit easier for you to go and tackle to fight that natural tendency to just be a sloth.

**Ali Abdaal:** There's a great book I read over the weekend or listened to the audiobook of called Buy Back Your Time by Dan

**Sahil Bloom:** Martell. Martell, yeah.

###  [Balancing Transparency and Privacy in Personal Finances](https://share.snipd.com/snip/165322c8-6a5b-430d-bbb6-ccea364eb0f6) 

🎧 34:52 - 36:14 (01:21)

The speaker avoids discussing money and posting about it online to maintain privacy, but acknowledges the benefit of transparency in inspiring and educating others. As the speaker's life circumstances change, such as starting a family, the consideration of potential risks of being public about finances becomes more significant. This includes the concern for safety in different locations and the risk of potential kidnapping, leading to a reassessment of the approach to sharing personal financial information online.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Sahil Bloom:** I don't do that. Yeah. I never talk about money, you know, really. Like I don't post too much about it because I do think that that draw, you know, there's a plus side to it. People love that kind of transparency and they learn a lot from it and they get inspired by it. is risking you know it's just trade-offs um but anyway sorry continue yeah

**Ali Abdaal:** so i do that kind of stuff and increasingly you know now each year when i come to making the video like i was talking to my girlfriend about it for the 2022 video and she was saying that you know is this is this still a good idea and that kind of made me think that like hmm i haven't really thought about it to date. But you're right now that like, especially if I have a wife and child and family and stuff in the future. I mean, I don't own anywhere near as much as like footballers do. everyone kind of knows where they live based in London. But, you know, London is a fairly safe city. There are other places in the world that are a lot less safe. Tim Ferriss had the blog post about reasons not to become famous, where he talked about potentially, you know, getting kidnapped at random airports and random places that he would go to, which is why he has to use an alias and a fake name and book hotels under a fake name because they give, they sell their data sometimes to the kidnappers. all of those things kind of made me think, huh, I wonder if I should reassess my approach to sharing stuff online, especially when a family gets involved with this kind of stuff. So I was just curious what your

**Sahil Bloom:** take on was. I mean, my, it's

###  [Redefining Wealth Beyond Money](https://share.snipd.com/snip/25377533-becc-4344-8762-c585c92a2a01) 

🎧 39:25 - 40:46 (01:20)

The concept of comprehensively wealthy is about changing the traditional focus on money as the sole definition of wealth. It emphasizes the need for a new scoreboard that includes areas such as physical health, mental fitness, social wealth, and time wealth. This new perspective challenges the notion of measuring life solely based on financial status and advocates for a more holistic approach to happiness and fulfillment.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** So you mentioned this idea, I guess, like comprehensively wealthy a couple of times. What do you mean by that? So

**Sahil Bloom:** wealth beyond money, changing the scoreboard, right? Like, you know, this is what my book is about that I'm working on now. It's basically this whole idea that we have been so narrowly focused on money as the sole definition of wealth throughout the last several hundred years because it's so easily measured. You look up at the scoreboard and your money scoreboard and you can see it ticking up and down on a daily basis, right? I don't know if you've ever used Mint or Personal Capital or any one of these platforms, people refresh that thing daily just to see like, oh, did my number go up? I feel good. Did it go down? I feel bad. That's how they measure their whole life. And that's how they stack themselves up against everyone else. It's a daily scoreboard that you can look at. And I think we need a new scoreboard. I think that in order to live a truly happy and fulfilled existence, we need to expand what is on our scoreboard. And we need to think about these other areas of life. We need to think about our physical health and vitality. We need to think about our mental health, mental fitness, mental vitality. We need to think about our social wealth, cultural environments that we're in, the people, the depth of relationships. And we need to think about our time, most importantly. We need to think about being time wealthy and being able to actually use our time while we can use it. There's this tendency of humans of deferred happiness syndrome. Like,

###  [Redefining Retirement and Embracing the Present](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b5fc1d87-a7b2-4cba-a9bb-ee58d85e7a38) 

🎧 46:11 - 48:09 (01:57)

Many professionals work hard with the hope of enjoying a glamorous retirement, only to end up spending their time in retirement on mundane activities like watching TV. This highlights the importance of enjoying the present moment and having a balanced life. The speaker emphasizes the desire to have the flexibility to enjoy life now instead of waiting for retirement. The insight challenges the notion of deferring enjoyment to retirement and encourages embracing the present moment.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** would have to be able to play more World of Warcraft or whatever, which is still gone.

**Sahil Bloom:** I mean, Tim Ferriss, I think was one of the first people to ever really talk about this in 4-Hour Workweek. He talked about how there's this massive class of professional workers who, you know, work in banking or consulting or doctors or whatever it is, where you ask like, hey, why are you working so hard? Why are you doing this? And their answer is so that they can do X, Y, or Z when they retire, so that they have the money to do X, Y, or Z, so that I can retire in Greece or so that I can like buy a vineyard and go retire on this vineyard, you know, in Napa or whatever it is at the end of all that time. And the vast majority of them don't do it. The Wall Street Journal just released. I don't know if you saw this. The Wall Street Journal released a breakdown of how people spend their time in retirement. And it was horrifying because it was like four and a half hours a day of watching TV was one of the things on the list. And it was basically a call to action of if you think that you're doing all of this work because you're going to have this glamorous retirement, living on the beach and sipping piña coladas, you're kidding yourself. What you're going to end up doing is sitting around and watching television because you're going to be 70 and you're not going to have the energy and the physical health to go do all those things probably. You're going to have to be stuck at home. And for me, what that means is I really want to enjoy the present. Like I want to be able to jump on a plane on Monday morning, fly to London, see you have a great dinner together and then fly back. And I have the flexibility to do that in my life. So why not do it? Because I want to do that now. I don't want to wait until I finish my book or until I hit some financial milestone that's arbitrary, that's just going to change as soon as I get there to whatever the next thing is. I want to really embrace and really enjoy this present moment. There's

**Ali Abdaal:** got to be a balance there, right? So you might have come across the book, The Decade. Oh, there are friends of mine that are reading it recently. I can't remember who it's by, but basically, The Def decade argues that your twenties are the defining decade.

###  [The Trap of Lifestyle Creep and High Income Expectations](https://share.snipd.com/snip/72e79b85-451f-4171-9c15-00cdd65cc448) 

🎧 50:12 - 51:31 (01:19)

The trap of a high-income career is that as your lifestyle creeps up, you become accustomed to a certain level of luxury and comfort. This leads to continuously increasing income expectations in order to feel 'rich'. Consequently, people end up hustling through their 30s, hoping to chill at 40, but often find that their children have grown up and don't want to hang out anymore. The 'magic years' from zero to 10, when children truly care about their parents, are lost due to excessive work. The approach advocated is hustling in the 20s to build a foundation and identify high leverage opportunities to achieve a more balanced life, but it's acknowledged that most people won't take this path.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Sahil Bloom:** the gravity of that career track has only increased keeping you in it. And the golden handcuffs have only increased because your lifestyle has crept up over those years. So now, you know, you might be making half a million dollars a year feeling rich, but your whole life has crept up. You're living in a nice apartment, you know, you've got high tax rate, you like got the nice car that cost you $1,000 a month. And all of a sudden, you're like, well, crap, I actually got to make a million dollars for myself to feel rich. And then you make a million and you're like, damn, I got to make $2 million to actually feel rich. And so what happens is, you don't get to 30 and start chilling to hang out with your kids. You hustle through your 30s thinking, I'm going to chill at 40. And then you get to 40 and maybe you are ready to chill, but your kids don't want to hang out with you anymore because they're 10 and they have friends. Like the time from by the time they're zero to 10, I've seen someone call it the magic years. Like that period from zero to 10 where they actually care about you so much, like are their favorite person in the entire world. And yet we work so hard during that period of time, we have no time, we're traveling, we're doing whatever it is. And that's a real travesty, in my opinion. And so if you could actually do that, if you could hustle in your 20s, to build the foundation to figure out your highest leverage opportunities, and then dive in to where those high leverage opportunities are, That's what I'm doing. And I think it's amazing if you can make it work. But most people won't do that. Most

###  [Work Hard first to Work Smart Later](https://share.snipd.com/snip/30fc0a63-45ec-4e07-899c-0b0f8a2888b6) 

🎧 52:54 - 55:38 (02:43)

Work hard in your 20s to build a foundation and uncover opportunities. Then you can work smart later. There's no hack to success, just grind and keep going. It's like being a stone cutter, each crack contributes to splitting the stone open at the end.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** is there an easy mental model for this to kind of balance out on the one hand the idea that you got a hashtag hustle in your 20s to a foundation versus you actually do want to chill. Yeah.

**Sahil Bloom:** I mean, I think it's the way I've always thought about it, the like simple heuristic for it is you work hard first so that you can work smart later. Okay. Those two were always played off of each other in tension. It like, you're either working hard or you're working smart. And I just don't, I don't think their intention, I think they're sequential. I think that it's really important to work hard early in your career. I will never tell anyone like, oh, don't, know, just work smart early in your career. Bugged me to no end when people would join, you know, our firm as 22 year olds and want all this balance and want to be able to like spend time with all their friends and you know have the high paying job and it's like i just think you have to pick one you can spend time with tons of your friends and like go work at the cushy you know google gig or whatever but that wasn't the career track we were in you need to work hard if you want to accelerate and build great things um and then you can work smart once you've done that once you've built that base once you've built that foundation. The hard work is important because of what I said earlier. You need to uncover the map. You need to uncover what the high leverage opportunities are for you because you don't know. When you're starting at age 22, you have no idea what's out there. You don't know what you're good at. You don't know what you're bad at. You don't know where the gold is on the map. You don't know where gold is going to be on the map in the future because you have no heuristics. You have no tools at your disposal. You're just starting to learn. And the hard work, the saying yes to tons of opportunities that come your way, the hours that come with that, that's what allows you to see the map. I mean, the same goes for content creators. It's like, I don't know a single content creator that has become big that didn't grind in the early days of getting things going. There's no easy way to do it. There's no like hack to building one of these things. You spend hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours creating and banging your head into a wall and frustrated because something didn't take off the way you thought it should. But all of those little things contribute to where you are in the end. It's like the stone cutter analogy of, you know, the stone cutter is chipping away at the stone over and over again. You don't see a single, you know, ch in the stone and then suddenly the whole thing breaks. And you would never say that those hundred cracks at it had no impact. They clearly were just doing a little bit of damage, a little bit of damage, a little bit of damage that you just couldn't see, but they were an integral part of actually splitting the thing open at the end. And so I think that exact same thing applies to the way that we work in our lives. You have to do of that hard work upfront because that's what allows you to effectively work smart once you get to that point. Nice.

###  [Importance of Working Hard Before Working Smart](https://share.snipd.com/snip/63ebd47a-76bc-4610-b4d1-fa913a21e995) 

🎧 53:10 - 55:09 (01:59)

The key insight is that working hard is crucial early in one's career to lay a foundation and uncover high leverage opportunities. It is emphasized that working hard allows individuals to uncover the map, say yes to various opportunities, and learn without preconceived tools or heuristics. This insight extends to content creators, highlighting the necessity of grinding in the early stages to achieve success, with no shortcuts or hacks available.

###  [Finding Fulfillment and Meaningful Impact in Career Planning](https://share.snipd.com/snip/089d2fb2-8c28-4552-ac64-c18d11bf77ce) 

🎧 01:00:07 - 01:01:31 (01:24)

The website 80000hours.org offers information on planning and changing careers for greater fulfillment and positive impact. The speaker draws an analogy to tabletop board games, emphasizing the need for an 'economic engine' in career planning. This 'economic engine' can come from sources like trust funds or investments, providing freedom and flexibility in career choices.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** that's 80,000hours, h-o forward slash deep dive, and that will give you so much more information on how to start planning or changing your career to something that's fulfilling and meaningful and has a positive impact on the world. So thank you so much, 80,000hours, for very kindly sponsoring this episode. The other way that I kind of think about this is in the context of tabletop board games. There's games like Catan and these other more kind of fancier ones. There's always some kind of production engine or some kind of economic engine, whether it's in Agricola, you have your little workers in the farm and you're generating units of food, or you've got your little sheep and you're generating units of sheep, in Catan, like wood and hay and stone and all that crap. And whenever you're playing one of these board games, you have to have an economic engine of some sort. You can't just play the game and just be like, I'm just going to build an army with Watts. You've got to have some kind of production machine. And so in the back of my mind, there's this analogy of everyone needs an economic engine of some sort. Either that's the fund from your parents or from your grandparents or whatever that might be, in which case great or rather not so great. But you've got to figure out what's going to drive that engine. And preferably, and I guess this is the place where you've gotten to with your holding company, the more you can untether that from your physical hours invested, the more you're able to unlock freedom and optionality for yourself.

###  [Freedom to Invest Time in What Matters](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8ba93f03-aad4-45a0-98a5-780c879224d5) 

🎧 01:01:38 - 01:02:43 (01:04)

The speaker emphasizes the importance of having the freedom to invest time in activities one truly desires, rather than feeling shackled to obligations. They highlight the need to break free from tasks that don't align with their passions, referencing their experience with running a YouTube Academy. The speaker also mentions a quote from Navalle that resonates with their life goals.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** And that's the freedom to choose to invest in the things you actually want to invest your time in. Because the objective isn't to sit in the beach sipping pina coladas, the objective is to, you know, at least for me to, you know, have freedom away from the things i don't want to do and freedom to do the things that i actually do want to do without feeling like i'm shackled to a job that is forcing me to yeah do a certain thing do

**Sahil Bloom:** you ever feel that way with creating videos do you ever have to like feel like oh man i have to create a video this week and i'm not excited about what i have to create yes

**Ali Abdaal:** and that whenever i feel that like that's always a little bit of like a hmm i was feeling that a lot for our part-time youtuber academy which is the life course that i've been running for the last two and a half years which is why this is like we're in middle of the very last one because i realized that yes it's making a couple million a year but like it's it's not worth it because when it comes around to it, I do feel like I'm having to do it. This time around, it's different because I'm like, I'm doing it for the last time.

**Sahil Bloom:** So now I'm really bringing all the energy and it's like so good. Sure. I go back to the, you mentioned Naval earlier. There's a Naval quote that has been, that has like always really resonated with me and it kind of defines what I'm actually going after in life. And

**Ali Abdaal:** that whenever i feel that like that's always a little bit of like a hmm i was feeling that a lot for our part-time youtuber academy which is the life course that i've been running for the last two and a half years which is why this is like we're in middle of the very last one because i realized that yes it's making a couple million a year but like it's it's not worth it because when it comes around to it, I do feel like I'm having to do it. This time around, it's different because I'm like, I'm doing it for the last time.

**Sahil Bloom:** So now I'm really bringing all the energy and it's like so good. Sure. I go back to the, you mentioned Naval earlier. There's a Naval quote that has been, that has like always really resonated with me and it kind of defines what I'm actually going after in life. And it was a fit body, a calm mind, and a house full of love. These are things that cannot be bought, they must be earned. A fit body, a calm mind, and a house full of love. And that to me is like my guiding light when I think about things. Like, what do I want? I want to achieve things that have to be earned, that cannot be bought. And that's what I want in life. want to go after the things that I have to earn. I just think there's this massive importance of actually going out and earning things rather than being given to you or rather than just being able to buy them and manifest them through money. It's like if you were to be placed at the top of a mountain today like we picked you up out of here out of this chair and dropped you off at the top of a mountain you would pass out because you wouldn't be acclimatized to the altitude you would literally pass out and

###  [Prioritizing an Infinite Game of Joyful Living](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0cdbf758-85b8-4d95-9c41-f93627e081ff) 

🎧 01:07:36 - 01:08:47 (01:11)

The speaker is focused on playing an infinite game where they can continue creating content, sharing knowledge, and bringing intrinsic joy to their life. They prioritize a schedule that revolves around activities they love, regardless of financial gains, and aim to avoid feeling compelled to do something they dislike, drawn from negative examples observed in the medical field.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** a good question i think i am trying to do essentially i'm trying to play i'm i'm trying to keep on playing my infinite game in the sense that right now i feel like if i won the lottery there is very little that would change about my schedule i wouldn't other than the fact i wouldn't run courses anymore and i would not take on any sponsorships those are like the two areas where the reason i'm doing the thing is for the money but i would still make YouTube videos. I will still do podcasts. I will still hang out with people like you. And I would still want to have a team that will help me create content and share it with the world. Because that's the thing that brings me an intrinsic joy in some capacity, like teaching and sharing and stuff. And so given that that's the infinite game, what I'm trying to optimize for is just being able to continue living that kind of life. I can wake up every morning and think that, yeah, I don't have to do something. And I think the reason I feel I'm so tied to that idea is because throughout my time in medical school and throughout my time working, I saw so many examples of doctors who hated their lives. And

###  [Embracing the Role of a Guide in Sharing Knowledge](https://share.snipd.com/snip/19358549-22a2-4e79-b2c1-8ff853b5ce4d) 

🎧 01:16:26 - 01:17:21 (00:54)

The speaker emphasizes the concept of being a guide rather than a guru when sharing knowledge, and even mentions the possibility of being a fellow traveler on the same path. They apply this concept by titling their videos as 'how I do X' and focusing on sharing personal strategies and templates, rather than using clickbait titles. This approach reflects their preference for being a humble guide and providing valuable information to their audience.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** i think that's pretty pretty similar to how i think about it um i you know came across an interesting way of thinking about this through my writing coach a couple years ago which was you don't need to be a guru you can be a guide instead like guide versus guru um and you sometimes don't even need to be a guide you can be a fellow traveler along the same path yeah

**Sahil Bloom:** stumbling traveler yeah and

**Ali Abdaal:** i i think about that a lot um this is why still to this day um a lot of our videos are titled like how i do x like i was working on right now about how i manage my time where i was thinking yeah in this video i'm just going to share three strategies plus like a googleets template that I've been getting a lot of value out in the last six months to help me take better care of my time. And maybe the more better thing to like, you know, 10 tips to manage your time or 10 tips to level up your life.

###  [The Power of the Cold Plunge](https://share.snipd.com/snip/620129a6-37a0-4643-b582-017a3447194e) 

🎧 01:22:40 - 01:24:39 (01:58)

Engaging in a daily cold plunge involves exerting mental control and discipline to overcome resistance, leading to positive reinforcement of being a disciplined person. The activity is viewed as a mental exercise rather than a physical one, and the act of following through on the commitment creates positive momentum and reinforces beliefs about oneself as a disciplined individual.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Sahil Bloom:** never been able to get myself to meditate on a daily basis. have, I would say two. One has been the cold plunge. You know, I go and get into freezing cold water at about 4.30 in the morning, every single morning. How and why does that work? What's going on there? So, I mean, the cold plunge has now become this like very trendy thing because Andrew Huberman, you know, has made it really popular and it's become this very polarizing thing on Twitter and on all the, you know, different platforms of like doing the cold plunge. Part of the reason it's been polarizing, by the way, is because there was a period of time where if you just posted a video of yourself doing a cold plunge, like every day on Instagram, you could like pretty reliably build like 50,000 follower audience just because they were like popping off, like every single video would just take off. The cold punch for me, there are all sorts of physical health benefits that are purported, you know, that like different studies have found. That to me, like if any of that is true, that's all upside and bonus. I view it as a purely mental activity where I wake up first thing in the morning and I have to exert a degree of mind control in order to get myself to do this because I don't want to do it. It's miserable. You go and you're getting into freezing cold water out on my deck, which is outside in the cold. I got out of my warm bed, 4.30 in the morning, it's pitch black and I have to go outside on my deck and go get into this water. And for me, every single morning, the mental gymnastics starts. I'm I don't need to do this. I can do it later. It actually be better for me if I do it later, because then I'll like really stay in there longer, whatever you start convincing yourself. And I have to exert that control over myself to say like, nope, I said, I'm going to do this. I'm going to go outside and I'm going to do it. And when you do that, it's like a little bit of confirmation bias in your life where your beliefs start creating your reality. Your beliefs about yourself as a disciplined person that does the things that you say you're going to do start getting confirmed by evidence that you're accruing. You create like a little positive momentum of this piece of evidence that you just put on the board that you are doing the things that you say you're going to do. And

**Ali Abdaal:** was like,

**Sahil Bloom:** shit,

**Ali Abdaal:** you're right. And so we actually did a group brainstorm. that your newsletter. It was Oh, nice. Yeah. A little whiteboard. It like, we made it we were like monday tuesday wednesday and then we were thinking about it i was like okay right now like my coaching session with eric is like on a tuesday and that kind of derails filming on a tuesday and they're like can't you just move it to a wednesday yeah and i was like that's a great idea what if what if wednesdays was all my and i was like but i want to have time i want to have a calendar where if a cool person wants to connect over zoom it's like i want to be able to talk to them they're like what about just doing those on wednesday afternoon and i was like oh my god you're so right yeah so now i have wednesday afternoons it's like my calls which i'll take on zoom while going for a walk around hide park because why not yeah and when i follow the ideal week i'm just like life is great because i've literally decided what are the elements i want in my life yeah and they're literally in this week yeah and if i and it's also great then because if i want to add something new i know it needs to fit in the calendar somehow like i kind of burned myself out a bit post quitting the job when i was like i'm going to take singing lessons three times a week and guitar lessons three times a week and art lessons three times a week because i really want to get better at guitar and singing and art yeah and then after about a week i was like oh my god like i'm not looking forward to this anymore etc etc as now i've decided that like yeah if there's no space for it in the calendar, that means there's no space for it in my life. And it becomes a very easy kind of by like by virtue of the fact that it's a calendar, you can't overlap things. And so it's just such a nice way of organizing my time.

**Sahil Bloom:** I love that. I mean, we make time for the things we care about and it's never a lack of time. It's always a lack of priorities. And so if something really matters to you you'll make time in the calendar for it it'll become a part of your of your ideal week i do think that that week framework is a really good adaptation of my day
