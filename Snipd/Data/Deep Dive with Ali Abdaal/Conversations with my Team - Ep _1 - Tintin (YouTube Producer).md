###  [Following the Path of Learning and Growth](https://share.snipd.com/snip/717a1f20-0c2b-4fe7-8f4b-f72653128ed3) 

🎧 18:59 - 20:21 (01:21)

The individual didn't have a grand plan but aimed to learn about education and online business by working with someone making progress in that field. They didn't have a specific destination in mind but focused on aligning their direction towards learning the most about their interests. Rather than having a clear endpoint, the individual viewed their journey as a process of aligning their direction and allowing the path to reveal itself over time.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Tintin Smith:** was what I was, that was what I was thinking. It was not like I had a grand plan. And around the time that the job application came up to work here, I was like, okay, Ali is making progress in this world and seems like he would be, I would learn a lot about education and online business working for him. So when that, when that job came up, I was like, okay, I'm just going to follow this dude or go in this dude's direction. Cause he's kind of in this world. Um, and it was very much like a i didn't know the specifics but i was just like i was thinking where am i to learn the most about the things that i want to be working on if that kind of makes

**Ali Abdaal:** sense yeah that makes sense so it sounds like you didn't have a specific destination in mind but you aligned your direction you were like currently my direction is consulting and i can see a few destinations along the way that don't really vibe with me because i can see the destinations but actually this new path this path this path is like youtube entrepreneur education world there's something here i don't know exactly what it is and so if a friend had asked you what's all this leading to your answer would have been i don't freaking know but i just i'm just aligning i'm just tweaking my direction the compass point so i'm going in that way and I'll go in that direction and see, and the path will reveal itself over time. Is that reasonable?

**Tintin Smith:** Yeah, a hundred percent. Like that's exactly all of the things I was kind of writing about in my newsletter each week was like, I don't know where I'm going. I

###  [Entrepreneurial Mindset and Understanding Money](https://share.snipd.com/snip/005eeee5-86fc-4393-8664-a67fcbd26591) 

🎧 48:15 - 49:50 (01:35)

Some individuals inherently grasp the concept of money circulation and market value, displaying entrepreneurial traits from a young age. They effortlessly comprehend how to earn, acquire, and increase money, recognizing the exchange of value for income early on. In contrast, others may take longer to recognize the connection between providing a valuable service and receiving compensation. The entrepreneurial mindset, often associated with individuals like Gary Vee, involves an innate understanding of conducting business and monetizing efforts, evident in stories of hustling at a young age. While some individuals swiftly perceive the dynamics of money and value creation, many others are limited by conventional views, primarily focusing on employment for income and traditional salary increments.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Tintin Smith:** so understand. Yeah. Um, I'll expand on it. But like, I feel like maybe this again is me projecting and maybe you actually had to go through this journey and all that kind of stuff. And it probably is more that actually, but I feel like people just understand how money moves through the world and how like money kind of um like is yeah how to earn money how to get money kind of how to have market value all this kind of stuff like people just understand the scale of it and they're like the kind of they're just naturally entrepreneurial basically people like Gary V kind of selling sweets at school and like flipping stuff at age 11 like that whole mindset is like often more people associate with being an entrepreneur. And you had that from like age 13, you kind of understood that you could, Oh, I could do a thing and it would like, I could exchange it for money. Um, and I feel like some people take a lot longer to come around to that idea of like, yeah, doing something useful and getting paid for it. And I feel like some people just understand, have that, have that entrepreneurial mindset very naturally. Um, yeah. Yeah.

**Ali Abdaal:** I guess so like when I hear the stories of like people who were like hustling and when they were 11 selling suites and stuff, I always know I'm going to vibe with that sort of person. Cause that was basically what I was doing, just selling websites on the internet rather than selling suites. And I'm often surprised by the lack of agents personal agency that people have when it comes to their earning potential where it feels like for a lot of normal people the way you earn money is at your job and like the way you get earn more money is by asking for a raise in the right way and your boss is an asshole if he didn't give you the raise because in line with inflation and

###  [Balancing Involvement in Business Leadership](https://share.snipd.com/snip/105090e3-0098-421e-adf3-51151a91bc17) 

🎧 54:16 - 55:31 (01:15)

Leaders must find a balance between being actively involved in business decisions and knowing when their involvement may hinder progress. It is crucial for leaders to assess their level of involvement in different aspects of the business; while some areas like new product development and managing the YouTube channel require their active participation, they must avoid seagull management - swooping in, causing chaos, and leaving. Maintaining a zoomed-out perspective due to not being involved in day-to-day operations can offer valuable insights, but leaders should be cautious not to overstep and hinder the team's progress towards common goals.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Tintin Smith:** What are your thoughts on that? Yeah.

**Ali Abdaal:** I also think that, yeah, the team is much better now than they were two, three years ago, uh, as a leader, I mean, leaders, me and Angus are way better than we were three years ago. Um, and yeah, it's always a bit of a balancing act with me of like knowing like like like between me and angus around like both of us want the business to to 10 million and it's just that like what to what extent is my involvement in stuff actually useful and and to what point does it become a hindrance uh to that particular goal um and again i'm not sure i think when it comes to new product development and when it comes to the youtube channel those are two areas that i need to be very involved in i think also yeah it's like because i'm not in the day-to i do have a more zoomed out perspective on things than people involved in the day-to do. But there's a balance between that, but, and also like kind of seagull management where you come in, you make a lot of noise, you shit over everyone's heads, and then you leave. Uh, and that is like also clearly not helpful. And so getting this balancing act being like, how involved do I want to be versus how i'm not involved do want to be with things yeah

###  [Achievement Over Money](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5fa7d943-ddbc-430e-ad48-75c787dfa8c6) 

🎧 01:15:22 - 01:17:05 (01:43)

The speaker has realized that the primary goal behind their work is not money but rather the desire to create something cool, achieve personal satisfaction, explore their potential, and gain respect from others. They value building something and contributing more than financial success, as evidenced by wanting to reach a hundred thousand subscribers on YouTube rather than focusing on making money from it.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Tintin Smith:** think yeah i think that is um something i've also realized through working with you is like is nothing profoundly changes. But I've thought a lot about why am I doing all the things I'm doing? Like, is it money? And I think being so close to you and someone who like has, you know, reached their financial goals. I've realized that it's really not for me, actually, that's obviously a secondary goal. But the primary goal is actually just to do something cool. I want to, that's kind of it. It's like, I want to have like built something and contribute to something in like a, in a cool way. And I want to like, um, have like essentially achievement, but kind of like maybe a more kind of dressed up version of achievement, like, um, build something like satisfying for myself, um, kind of like, you know, explore my potential and all that kind of thing. Maybe there's a bit of a status element there, like trying to achieve, do something cool so that I can get kind of respect from others and stuff. And like, that's kind of fun, but it's actually less about the money. Cause like, if I wanted to make lots of money, I'd probably quit my job and be a full-time YouTube consultant and build a business around YouTube consulting or something. But yeah, I think I want to just... 100,000 subscribers on the YouTube channel would actually mean more to me than making money from the YouTube channel, just because it'd be like, I did something. I managed to like, yeah, to build something cool. I think I have an attachment to that idea now in hopefully a healthy way. Maybe there's all sorts of things going on there and like you could interrogate me on why and stuff, but yeah.

**Ali Abdaal:** Nice. That's
