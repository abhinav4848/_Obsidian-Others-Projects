###  [Entrepreneurship vs Trading: Zero-Sum Game](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6365aa1e-350f-48fb-ba7e-c395d85de577) 

🎧 04:30 - 05:25 (00:54)

Entrepreneurship and trading are different because trading is a zero-sum game where there are winners and losers. In trading, you can't add value to the shares or currencies; you have to trade and try to get in and out at the right time. Because of this, in trading, you are not likely to beat the winners.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** Okay. But surely this is too good to be true. I've heard that like, you know, entrepreneurship is like, you know, 99% of startups fail or whatever that number is. I know so many people who've bought a course on day trading trying to make money online and like they've just failed. it seems like the only people getting rich off of this are the people the courses yeah so what's what's going on there okay so

**Daniel Priestley:** great great uh first frame the first thing i'd say is entrepreneurship and trading are very very different right so trading is a zero-sum game you're buying and selling equities or you're buying and selling a financial instrument and these are zero-sum games there's winners and losers and there's nothing in between or there's brokers in between, but you can't value add. You can't buy some shares or some currencies and value add those. You have to basically trade those and try and get in and get at the right time. The reality is because it's a winner and loser sport, something like trading, you are not going to beat the winners, right?

###  [Adaptability and Innovation in the Digital Age](https://share.snipd.com/snip/dbf6e9d0-6ff4-4c59-9777-3171771e03ca) 

🎧 07:54 - 09:18 (01:24)

The digital age has transformed the traditional model of schooling into a new environment where geographically dispersed teams, niche business opportunities, and global customer bases thrive. In this environment, individuals can embrace creativity, innovation, exclusivity, and specialization. Additionally, entrepreneurship in the digital age involves identifying a problem and creating a solution, as opposed to developing a set of skills to fit into an employer's needs. The focus is now on understanding customer desires and providing comprehensive solutions rather than just selling individual strengths.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Daniel Priestley:** So the model for schooling was to create component labor, people who fit nicely into other people's businesses. Where we're at right now is very different. So the world that we live in right now is teams that are geographically spaced out, business opportunities that could be incredibly narrow and niche, but a mile deep, customer base that's all over the world. And you can, in that environment, you can actually be very different. You can be highly creative. You can be innovative. You can be exclusive. You can be specialized, all of those sorts of things. So it's a very different environment in the digital age. The next thing that I would say that's different is that when you're an entrepreneur, you're looking at a problem that exists and you're trying to come up with a solution that fits that problem. When you've come out of a school system, you're developing a skill set and you're trying to find an employer that needs those skills. So, it's slightly different. So, when we think about like a Porsche 911, Porsche 911, they don't say, what are we good at? And they go, okay, we're really good at making the chassis of the car, but we don't do tires and we don't do stereo systems. So we're just going to sell the thing that we're good at. They say, what does the customer want? Well, the customer wants to be able to drive the car straight off the dealership and feel great about their purchase. And

###  [Understanding the Perspective of High Earners](https://share.snipd.com/snip/069f0768-6860-4d7b-8ec8-ea62887875fa) 

🎧 50:20 - 51:36 (01:16)

High earners, such as the top 1%, have an average annual income of $360,000, leading to a daily income of approximately $1,000. Their time is highly valuable, and their activities are benchmarked against their income-generating potential. When targeting individuals with high disposable income, it's crucial to consider the perspective of return on investment. What may be considered expensive to an average income earner, such as a Ferrari, could be perceived as a mere marketing budget or capital expense to high earners or industry professionals.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Daniel Priestley:** then once you get in there, the average earnings of a top 1% is 360,000 a year. So they're on about a grand a day, 360 days a year. So you don't need many of those people and they've got no time. And everything that they do is benchmarked against what they do to create that income. So like, let's say they're a surgeon, anytime they're not being a surgeon, like mowing their lawns or, you know, dropping kids at school or any of that sort of stuff, they're losing money because they can be earning a lot of money in the thing that they're earning a lot of money at. So if you can figure out how do I sell to people who've got that kind of money, that's helpful. So a really good idea is to just start by thinking who has the highest return on investment? Is a Ferrari an expensive car? Yes. Depends who's asking. It depends who's looking at it. So, to an average income earning person, a Ferrari is a very expensive car. To a billionaire, it's just a toy. It's no big deal. To an influencer who makes their money influencing young men and that's their, like, it's just their marketing budget, right? It's just part of marketing. To someone who owns a luxury car company that rents the Ferrari out, it's capex. It's just a capital expense.

###  [Get Close Enough to Lick their Face](https://share.snipd.com/snip/09c309f7-31c7-4006-89ac-02c1ff652eac) 

🎧 56:50 - 58:11 (01:20)

In the chaos model, the key elements are concept, audience, offer, and sales. When presenting an offer, it's important to physically interact with the audience to observe their reactions. Although some may prefer to create and sell products from a distance, it is essential in the early stages of a business to closely engage with customers and potential clients to understand their reactions and interactions.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** fine. So concept. We're in the chaos model. What

**Daniel Priestley:** is the chaos model? Okay. Then we're doing audience, right? Concept audience. So we said the WhatsApp group and the event and the quiz. The next thing is offer. So the offer is constructing an offer that is a couple of grand. And the fourth thing is sales. So we kind of covered it. So it's concept audience offer sales. The offer is where we present people with either a slide deck or a brochure or sometimes a web page. But I really love to present it physically to people. I love to be sitting eyeball to eyeball when I present this because I want to see how they actually react.

**Ali Abdaal:** Oh, wait, so you're saying I have actually talk to people and sell them this thing? Yes. Nah, come on. That's not my idea of what a business is. I thought I'd just sit in my bedroom and make something and then suddenly become millionaire.

**Daniel Priestley:** You eventually do. But when you're starting a business, you want to get close enough to lick their face. You want to be right up close to your customers. You want to see exactly how they interact. Isn't that such an

**Ali Abdaal:** old school way of like thinking about business? Surely the world has changed. Surely I can just like make an app or something.

**Daniel Priestley:** Yeah. The best tech entrepreneurs I know, they love to get hands, really hand on with a client, with a potential client. So in the early days, we're talking about going in stages. And stage one, we just want to see how does the person react?

###  [Focus on being the organizing force](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b85f9241-8b7e-4b02-8b01-aeb3643c5f72) 

🎧 01:01:40 - 01:03:09 (01:28)

Consider leveraging your skills in camera usage and video editing to offer personalized video content services to affluent clients such as startup founders or business owners. Offer a monthly package for filming and creating content for various social platforms, initially priced at two grand. Highlight the availability of a skilled team for creating different types of content, including style guide content and brute force content. Emphasize the idea of the entrepreneur's role being the organizing force rather than doing the actual work, and avoid getting stuck in doing the work yourself.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** if I was like, hey, I know how to use a camera. I know how to do video editing. therefore if i do personal brand video content for startup founders who i know have money or yeah business owners like you who i know have money and i could be like dan you have books you want to be on all the content social platforms i'll show up to your house once every month and we'll film a bunch of stuff i'll just ask you the questions i'll'll chop it up. Content for Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, et cetera, et cetera. Sign

**Daniel Priestley:** me up. Yeah. Rock and

**Ali Abdaal:** roll. Yeah. Of course. So that's, that's

**Daniel Priestley:** a great example. Yeah. And, um, and you just sign me up and you might say it's initially two grand and see if you like it. And it's two grand a month after that. Yeah. Um, now you might say, uh, by the way, I've got a whole team. I've got an amazing team of people. I've actually found I've got lead content creators here in the UK. I've also got an international team so that we can do an initial style guide and some signature content. And we can also do brute force content, you know, through our team in the Philippines. And we've got a team in Ghana. And actually, we send all the raw footage to them and they create lots of videos and we then put that on TikTok and all that sort of stuff. We see where it and bring it all together. I'm like, whoa, that sounds really great. So yeah, that would be like, I'm really big on the idea of the entrepreneur's job is to be the organizing force not to do the work. So like you keep getting into like, oh, I know how to edit videos. It's like, it's like that's doing the work. You're not being an entrepreneur. You're being in a video editor.

###  [Positive Sales Approach and Sales Process Steps](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b0f26c58-55dc-4928-a321-eb39e193f691) 

🎧 01:08:34 - 01:10:18 (01:44)

A positive sales approach involves a combination of product knowledge, rapport building, objection handling, and making professional recommendations without being pushy. The sales process includes maintaining a spreadsheet to track leads, booking appointments, presenting solutions, and finally asking for commitment from potential clients.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Daniel Priestley:** Oh, wow. It's like Peloton. They have a central sales trainer who does video, uploads to the iPads. They do 40 minutes of sales training every day. Oh, wow. They do a combination of product knowledge and they do uh rapport building objection handling and they actually make suggestions as to things you can buy right now today that's part of their process they want you to walk out of the store with something but it's positive they're professional right they're not pushy they are making recommendations they're trying to solve your problem if you go in there and say i'm a professional speaker and i like to give talks they're gonna go okay so you use a lot of keynote. Yeah, okay. Did you know that this thing here, this is like a touch bar and it actually shows you your slides as you're going through and you can see your slides when you're speaking and you can jump to slides from slide. It's like, oh, that I would use that all the time. Yeah, that's a really good thing that you might want to use. I want that. Great. Let's box it up. Okay. So they're doing 40 minutes of sales training a day, right? And it's a positive experience. Everyone likes geniuses. Yeah.

**Ali Abdaal:** But

**Daniel Priestley:** they're salespeople. Okay.

**Ali Abdaal:** So it sounds like to go from zero to 10K, we need to do is come up with some kind of concept that we can charge, 2K for. Yep. And find a way to land five clients a month through a sales process. sales

**Daniel Priestley:** process. I will say one more thing about sales. You need to learn how to do laps. Leads, appointments, presentations, sales. So you just keep a little spreadsheet. Who are your leads? Who are the people that might buy? Can you book an appointment to speak with them, right? Actually get their commitment to just focus. Can you present them with a solution? Can you actually do a presentation or an actual conversation? And then can you ask them whether they would like to go ahead or not? And those are the four steps, lead, appointment, presentation, sales.

###  [Entrepreneurship is Reluctant Pursuit with Potential Upside](https://share.snipd.com/snip/13fe9965-3b5e-4aa1-9f2f-19081fc4f001) 

🎧 01:11:33 - 01:13:13 (01:39)

Entrepreneurship is about spotting something in the world and wanting to bring it to life, doing it reluctantly but with eyes wide open. At the 10,000 a month sales mark, entrepreneurs can reach the level of a basic job, but with additional work, stress, and the risk of the whole operation collapsing if they stop. Staying curious and embracing critics is crucial in the zero to 10k a month bracket.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Daniel Priestley:** if they loved it. No, not at all. Provided they're enjoying it, they're adding value. Like entrepreneurship is, as I say, it's something you do reluctantly. You do it because you spot something in the world that you want to bring to life. You want to do this thing. It's like you go in eyes wide open. But look, I will say this, the upside with entrepreneurs, entrepreneurship is wild if you get it right. Like, so 10,000 a month is where you kind of like, 10,000 a month is where you're on par with a basic job. Because you're going to have a few overheads. So, you know, if you take a basic job and you say, okay, four or five grand a month, like NHS doctor, would they be on about five grand a month? Yeah, four or five grand-ish. So, you know... Okay, depending on what level, but yeah. Yeah. So essentially that 10 grand a month of sales minus an assistant, minus some costs of doing business is going to leave you with about four or five grand a month. So if you can do that, you're on par with a job, but you've got extra work, extra stress. And if you stop, the whole thing stops. So you're kind of like just benchmarking. You know, those games where there's like a shadow person and you're trying to keep up with that shadow person? So at 10 grand a month, you're kind of like neck and neck with your employed shadow person at that stage.

**Ali Abdaal:** Nice. Any final tips or resources for the zero to 10K a month bracket before we move beyond 10K a month?

**Daniel Priestley:** Final tips or resources. So concept audience offers sales. I would just say, just take it, stay curious, be embrace the critics. When someone says they don't like it, just ask why.

###  [Mutual Happiness in Capitalism](https://share.snipd.com/snip/24b79a2d-7629-4d81-97eb-a861b418ae5d) 

🎧 01:14:09 - 01:16:04 (01:55)

Capitalism and money create mutually beneficial transactions where both the buyer and the seller are happy with the exchange, due to the difference in the value of the product for each party. This leads to a system where every transaction involves two people walking away feeling like they got a great deal, contributing to the beauty of business and capitalism. The insight of mutual happiness in transactions underlines the incredible nature of the capitalist system.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** i know rationally that like yeah

**Daniel Priestley:** capitalism and money is the most pure and brilliant transaction it's the most incredible system the the marginal utility of a cup of coffee for a coffee shop owner is really low. They don't want that cup of coffee, right? The marginal utility of the coffee for the person who doesn't have a cup of coffee is high. And the marginal utility of their £2.50 or $3 is low. So everyone wins. Isn't that incredible? Like, think about that just for a moment. The coffee shop owner is so happy that you gave them $3 for the coffee. You're so happy that they have this coffee shop and that they were just willing to give you this delicious coffee and for $3. And you're like, I didn't want the $3. didn't care. There's my $3. Yay. Hot cup of coffee. Fantastic. And then they're like, yay, I got $3. I didn't need that extra cup of coffee. So this is the beauty of business that you essentially have two people who are super happy, super stoked. So this is what every transaction involves. Every single transaction that happens in the economy is two people who felt that they won. Two people felt that they walked away going, that is so great. I paid for something that I'm getting a great deal. And the person who sold it is like, yay, I made a sale. I love it. This is capitalism. And it's so It's the most incredible system. It sounds so obvious

**Ali Abdaal:** when you put it like that. But hearing you say that has sort of triggered some kind of surprise in me. I like, oh, yeah, I've just never considered that. I just sort of like, float around thinking, oh, people just buy and sell stuff. And but if I'm selling something that's bad, and if someone's buying from me, then like, oh, like, I better make sure like, I'm like not selling them snake oil. And it's all over the palpitation start.

**Daniel Priestley:** Yeah.

###  [Create a Product Ecosystem](https://share.snipd.com/snip/402630b8-a80c-453e-8682-74a112c8ea13) 

🎧 01:33:19 - 01:34:21 (01:01)

Consider the balance between creating products for your existing market and branching out into new areas. It's okay to have a product ecosystem. Think of yourself like the Eiffel Tower - while people are attracted to the main product, the real money is made from the things around it. Therefore, it's beneficial to have a variety of products and offerings that complement each other.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Daniel Priestley:** the balance okay

**Ali Abdaal:** so let's make it concrete with our youtuber academy for example um what's the balance between let me stay in my lane and just keep on making more products for my existing market of people wanting to start a YouTube channel versus, you know what? I'm kind of known for productivity. Let me start a productivity app.

**Daniel Priestley:** So people are willing to go on a journey with you, provided it's okay to have a product ecosystem. So I want you to think about yourself. I know this will sound strange. Imagine you're like the Eiffel Tower. Okay. But how does the Eiffel Tower make money? Actually, the real money is made in all the things around the Eiffel Tower. So when people go to hotels, restaurants, cafes, museums, galleries, that's all stuff that's around the Eiffel Tower. So people are attracted to the Eiffel Tower, but there's all the things around the Eiffel Tower that make all the money. Like very few people go to Paris and drop all their money on like a trip up to the Eiffel Tower and back. That's like,

**Ali Abdaal:** yeah, 15 quid or something. No, they

**Daniel Priestley:** like to be around it. They like to see it.

###  [The Eiffel Tower Principle for Personal Branding](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ac80fb18-5e47-47d6-80ce-ac29427f33e5) 

🎧 01:34:21 - 01:35:42 (01:21)

A key person of influence should be like the Eiffel Tower, with a product ecosystem around them. This can include multiple businesses, each with its own product ecosystem. Not every business has a key person of influence, and those that do are more likely to take off and be profitable.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Daniel Priestley:** They don't actually expect to spend all that much money on it. But this is what a personal brand should be like. A key person of influence should be the Eiffel Tower and they should have a product ecosystem around them. Me personally. So I've got the books out and I give talks and I'm on a podcast. But I actually have a publishing company called Rethink Press. I've got an awards business and a PR business called August. I've got a business that does capital fundraising. I've got an accelerator business called Dent. So there's all these businesses that I've got. I've got software business called ScoreApp. And these are all the things that are kind of selling. Each one has its own product ecosystem. All these products, if I'm out there talking, people are going, hey, what do you do? Let's get involved in it.

**Ali Abdaal:** Does every business have some kind of key person of influence?

**Daniel Priestley:** No, most businesses don't, which is why they don't take off. It's only a very narrow set of businesses that take off there's millions of there's actually millions of businesses in the uk yeah and there's tens of thousands that are really profitable so

**Ali Abdaal:** like the local laundromat does not have a key person of influence behind it no

**Daniel Priestley:** the

**Ali Abdaal:** local coffee shop probably doesn't unless it's james hoffman's coffee shop because he's like the most famous coffee guy in the world from his youtube channel and

###  [Capacity for Building a Multi-Billion Dollar Empire](https://share.snipd.com/snip/77c3de6d-88fc-4a60-99ed-b88ad28d2638) 

🎧 01:36:27 - 01:37:55 (01:27)

Having a large following can support the establishment of multiple successful businesses with only a few thousand customers needed to generate seven figures in revenue. A business can be expanded significantly when targeting a key audience and becoming a prominent figure in a specific industry. By leveraging existing connections and expertise, it's possible to build a multi-billion dollar empire, as demonstrated by the example of Mr. Beast.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Daniel Priestley:** You've got 4.5 million. 16,000 is a rounding error. Yeah. This is such a big following that you could have multiple businesses. You only need a few thousand customers to do a seven-figure business. So if you're a key person of influence for many millions of people, you can have multiple businesses. I mean, I only have tens of thousands of followers, and I've got multiple seven-figure businesses. So you could play much bigger. Mr. Beast, he's like turned down a billion dollars. He's like, I'm going to be much bigger than that. He's figuring it out, but he knows that he has the capacity to build a multi-billion dollar empire off the back of the Mr. Beast brand.

**Ali Abdaal:** Okay.

**Daniel Priestley:** So my web design agency, I'm

**Ali Abdaal:** becoming a key person of influence. Yep. Am I? But because I'm doing web design for doctors, I'm not bothering going to the web design conferences. I'm going to the doctor conferences.

**Daniel Priestley:** No, you're going to the customers. You're going to the market and you're speaking in front of them and you discover that there's a little podcast they're all listening to. So you become a guest on there and talk about digital strategy for doctors. But

**Ali Abdaal:** I'm not speaking and plugging my product.

**Daniel Priestley:** Well, you're the Eiffel Tower. So you're basically saying, hey, I wrote the book called Dr. Digital, and I'm a big believer in digital products for doctors or digital brands for doctors or personal brands for doctors. And

###  [The Power of Being a Key Person of Influence](https://share.snipd.com/snip/77d9e66d-710d-4178-934d-74177038f309) 

🎧 01:37:16 - 01:38:39 (01:22)

Becoming a key person of influence involves engaging with the market, speaking to the target audience, and discovering the platforms they use. By being a guest on relevant podcasts and speaking about digital strategy for doctors without directly promoting your product, you position yourself as an authority. When the audience shows interest, you guide them to your agency, leveraging your influence to connect them with your team.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** Okay.

**Daniel Priestley:** So my web design agency, I'm

**Ali Abdaal:** becoming a key person of influence. Yep. Am I? But because I'm doing web design for doctors, I'm not bothering going to the web design conferences. I'm going to the doctor conferences.

**Daniel Priestley:** No, you're going to the customers. You're going to the market and you're speaking in front of them and you discover that there's a little podcast they're all listening to. So you become a guest on there and talk about digital strategy for doctors. But

**Ali Abdaal:** I'm not speaking and plugging my product.

**Daniel Priestley:** Well, you're the Eiffel Tower. So you're basically saying, hey, I wrote the book called Dr. Digital, and I'm a big believer in digital products for doctors or digital brands for doctors or personal brands for doctors. And you're talking about this, and then they're saying, oh, like, how do we get this done? You say, well, I actually have an agency. You get in touch with my agency manager who's going to talk to you about that. Okay. Yeah, go talk to Eric. Eric is going to have a chat with you and you can have this great chat and Eric will tell you what to do next. Okay, nice. So think about it a bit like this. You know, in American football, the quarterback throws the ball to the other players and then they score the goals. But the quarterback is like the star of the show, even though they're not actually scoring the goals. So the key person of influence has a team and they're out there speaking, they're out there engaging with the marketplace, being a key person of influence. They're seeing opportunities and they go, take that one team, have that one team, have that one team. So

🎧 01:52:24 - 01:53:35 (01:10)

Staying connected and aligned used to be effortless with a small, self-organized team. As the team grew to six people and went remote, problem-solving became more challenging. Now, with more than six people, it's really hard to solve problems as effectively as before. The team is in a frustrating in-between stage, called 'crossing the desert', where they are not a big business nor a small business, making problem-solving even more challenging.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** we have we have to do in-person full week-long meetings every six weeks to stay connected stay connected and aligned and

**Daniel Priestley:** do you remember back in like eight nine ten people where it just self-organized like it just like we didn't have to do any of this stuff and everyone like we had a problem so what did we do we ordered chinese food and everyone came sat around a table and we solved the problem by the we finished dinner yeah

**Ali Abdaal:** ish i remember it was like that at three people when we were in person but then when we went to six and it became remote and different time zones and i didn't know anything about running business so it's just like yeah

**Daniel Priestley:** so even at about six or seven, I bet there were times where you just got on a Zoom call. Everyone on the Zoom call. An hour later, you'd solve the problem and everyone was like aware of it. And I bet it's really hard to do that now. Yeah, it's

**Ali Abdaal:** really hard to do that now. Yeah.

**Daniel Priestley:** So you've just entered this like too big to be small, too small to be big. We call this crossing the desert. It's like you're just in this like really frustrating time where you're not a big business, you're not a small business. So realistically, you can probably get away with it because you've got lots of IP media to leverage. For

###  [Scalability in Business Sectors](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bb29e625-2dad-464a-9b56-4056c8836ad7) 

🎧 02:06:34 - 02:08:01 (01:27)

Certain businesses like childcare centers have limited scalability due to strict regulations and high costs, making them challenging as a first business. In contrast, software, media, tech, and finance are highly scalable sectors, allowing for exponential growth and larger economies of scale.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Daniel Priestley:** seen it like four times in my career, someone who like gets 80 childcare centres and then goes bust. And why? Because it's highly regulated. It's every three children needs a carer or four children needs a carer, and you need a certain amount of space per child. So there's all these regulations. So there is no economy of scale. If you want to have 80 childcare centers, the costs associated are almost 80 times what one is. So it's impossible to get ahead. Software, on the other hand, you spend half a million building software and then it scales and you have 10,000 clients, 50,000 clients. But

**Ali Abdaal:** it's not good as a first business because it's a J-Code. It's

**Daniel Priestley:** a hard business to get off the ground. Okay. It's a hard first business, yeah. It's a bit of a black belt move, but worth it in the end. If you can end up in software, media, and tech, those are the big kind of scalable ones. Yeah.

**Ali Abdaal:** Like we're sort of in the process of building a productivity up moment. also finance scales. So doing- an investment firm or-

**Daniel Priestley:** Yeah. Raising a $10 million fund is not that much harder than raising a hundred million dollar fund and raising a billion dollar fund is not that much harder than raising a hundred million dollar fund. So, you know, there are private equity firms that have 12 people that have a billion dollars worth of assets under management, you know, so finance scales, software scales, IP scales, media scales. So

🎧 02:11:16 - 02:12:30 (01:14)

Having experience makes tasks seem easy, but those without experience may find them difficult. Managing multiple businesses can be easier than managing just one. With experience in investing, scaling up investments can seem feasible, requiring only a single influential connection.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** have we have an agency that's launching yeah there you go yeah um but if someone comes to me and says oh ali you know i really want to make an online course and it's really hard. And I'm like, it's easy. Just like bang, bang, bang. Because I've done that. Yeah, exactly. Everything's easy after you've done it. For me, having multiple

**Daniel Priestley:** business, I remember what it was like having one business. And I had this friend, Jeremy, Jeremy Harbour, who's amazing. And he wrote a great book called Go Do Deals. Jeremy had multiple businesses. had 13 companies at that time and he had like a jet and you know like houses around the world and all this sort of stuff i just how is it how is it you have multiple companies and he's like honestly it's easier than having one i'm like that makes no sense and now i'm that dude so yeah yeah you you would be the same. I imagine after you've done a few deals and you're like, actually, this totally, I'm an investor in this company, you know, and here's how it works and here's the dashboards. I'm copied in on quarterly updates. Awesome. And I bet you like do three or four of these and you're like, we could do 30 of these. It would be super scalable. and the whole investments alongside if you you would really only need one billionaire friend right you

###  [Scale Businesses for Higher Value Exits](https://share.snipd.com/snip/93d1a443-d851-4cac-9c58-ed0929cc9bff) 

🎧 02:13:54 - 02:15:34 (01:40)

The value of a business is often measured in terms of multiple years worth of profit or revenue. Building a business that does millions allows for the possibility of a significant return when the business sells. For instance, a $2 million SaaS business could potentially be sold for 10 to 20 million. This scalability potential surpasses that of creating courses, as seen in the scarcity of course creators on the rich list in comparison to those who buy and sell companies. The prospect of selling businesses has been endorsed by experts who have successfully engaged in multiple business sales. This path to wealth accumulation may seem unpredictable at first, but it offers the potential for substantial financial gains over time.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Daniel Priestley:** let me just sell you on the equity thing. One last thing. When a business sells, it normally sells for multiples of like years worth of profit or years worth of revenue right so if it's possible yeah to build a course that does millions yeah then theoretically it's possible to partner with a business that does millions and then when that business sells it sells for like a very low value exit might be seven years or eight years worth of profit in one transaction. And if it's a software company, it's probably going to sell for seven to 10 times the revenue. So if you could build a 2 million a year SaaS business, you might sell that like 10 to 14, 15 million, maybe 20 million. So like these things scale up a lot faster than courses. That's true. If you look on the-

**Ali Abdaal:** I'm blinkered to courses because

**Daniel Priestley:** it's what I know. If you look at the rich list, there's not a lot of course creators.

**Ali Abdaal:** No.

**Daniel Priestley:** But there's a lot of people who buy and sell companies.

**Ali Abdaal:** Yeah. So

**Daniel Priestley:** yeah know keep an open mind to it but you've got plenty of time up your sleeve yeah

**Ali Abdaal:** maybe that's the next the next game buying and selling companies we'll see that's what uh cody sanchez was trying to sell me on as well she's done like 26 different companies

**Daniel Priestley:** yeah she's she is doing that and and she yeah i mean it's worth watching and seeing how and alex homozy's doing that oh yeah yeah um what do you think about that whole journey and does it actually start sounding predictable because at the beginning it's like hey like is this actually predictable like does it sound like a predictable set of steps because i'm so close to it to

**Ali Abdaal:** me yeah it's

###  [Creating Opportunities for Sales Calls](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e7ca4f87-4a2e-412f-ac3d-f37db454a321) 

🎧 02:15:57 - 02:17:15 (01:18)

The role of being a key person of influence involves creating opportunities for sales calls rather than directly making the calls. It's about creating a wake of opportunity and passing it down to the team to monetize. This is similar to the way partners at KPMG or Goldman Sachs create relationships and pass them down for the team to execute. It involves generating media, intellectual property, and technology, and breaking it down makes it seem more predictable.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** but but i guess given that i've never done a sales call in my life to me the idea of a sales call feels like, oh, that feels hard. You're

**Daniel Priestley:** doing the key person of influence role. You're creating the opportunity. Someone's doing the sales

**Ali Abdaal:** calls. That key person of influence role feels really easy. I'm just like, yeah, easy. Someone's doing the sales calls. So

**Daniel Priestley:** what you're doing is creating the space for those sales calls to happen. Look, if you go to KPMG, there's someone called a partner and the partner opens up big relationships and then passes them down to the analysts and all that sort of stuff and it's the same it's the same deal yeah you know the goldman sachs guy he's out there like signing up the company that wants to float and then passing it to the team to like pin it down yeah and do do the thing you are the key person of influence who creates a wake of opportunity and you've got a team who know how to monetize that opportunity. That's the relationship. That's the real business. So you're doing the right thing. This is working. Yeah, it's working. And you do have, you've got a team. You've got a company. You've got like- We pay tax. You pay tax. I look at our management accounts every month you generate media intellectual property technology yeah um yeah like all of these things are proper business things but i

**Ali Abdaal:** think i think breaking it down like this definitely does make it seem more predictable it

###  [Entrepreneurship: Bigger Carrots and Sticks](https://share.snipd.com/snip/df37d7e8-d70f-432d-abb0-44fd37f958d6) 

🎧 02:17:24 - 02:19:22 (01:58)

Entrepreneurship is not easy, but the potential payback is huge, with the opportunity to earn in one hit what most people earn in their entire career. The game of entrepreneurship has significant upside, such as scalability, but it also comes with downsides like stress and complexity. Those who endure the rough roads at the beginning tend to achieve breakthroughs and scalability, while those who have an easy life often struggle towards the end. The motivation for entrepreneurs is driven by bigger carrots and sticks, making it hard for them to divert their focus. The speaker is excited about the huge opportunity in their software business and the impact they are making on their team in Ukraine, who would otherwise be on the front line in the army.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** not like an easy thing of just like oh just just learn to code and build a software in your pajamas in your bedroom and suddenly you're making 10k

**Daniel Priestley:** yeah it's hard the whole thing is hard yeah but that's but like the payback is huge yeah like millions millions and millions you sell a if you sell a company you earn what most people earn in their entire career yeah in one hit so like if you take someone who's on 50 grand times 40 years what's that two million yeah so yeah and they they pay tax like that's a career and you don't have to sell it like a two million exit is not a big exit yeah um so the entrepreneurship game has upside, but the downside is stress. The downside is complexity. The downside is you see someone reading fiction and you think, wow, I wish I could read. You have bigger carrots and bigger sticks as an entrepreneur. You know what I mean? Everything that motivates humans is carrot and stick, and the sticks are bigger and the carrots are bigger. So, you know, that's the path. And it typically is that rough roads end smooth and smooth roads end rough. So people who have a really nice, easy life typically struggle towards the end. And people who put in the grit at the beginning get a breakthrough and then upside scalability. So, you know, you've got to pick which hard you want. Why don't you just read fiction? You've got enough money. Because of the carrots and the sticks. At the moment, I've got a software business and the upside is 100 million plus. And I can't stop thinking about building a great company i'm really excited by what we do um it's a huge opportunity as a business but it's also a fun business we we we're building quizzes right and we're using ai and we're doing data and we've got this amazing team in in um ukraine who if it wasn't for us they would be enrolled in the army and they'd be on the front line and
