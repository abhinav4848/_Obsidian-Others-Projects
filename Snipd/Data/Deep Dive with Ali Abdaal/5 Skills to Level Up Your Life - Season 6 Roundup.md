#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** Okay, so let's get on with this episode. So first up, we have the money expert Cody Sanchez. And Cody is teaching us how we can maximize our wealth and our money over time. Your first $100,000 comes faster if you earn before you invest. Yeah,

too many people want to take a dollar and invest in the stock market and have a Robinhood trade do well for them or a Bitcoin go up or down, or an NFT. And I think it's completely wrong. You should optimize first. We have a strategy called learn, which is basically we want you to focus first on earning money before you do anything. And the reason why is because you can't, if you have money, it's always easier to make money. Rule number one, in order to make money, you have to first do the thing that is easiest and highest ROI. That's typically not going to be that you put a dollar into the stock market and it makes you $100,000. But what you could do is you could negotiate a salary increase of 5% to 20% each year or by annually, and you're much more likely to then be able to invest that money intelligently. But a lot of people, you know, instead of first earning and then learning and then investing, they go invest, learn, earn. And I think that's the opposite of what we want to do. Too many people have seen people make a lot of money in investing and it's a long game. Yeah.

**Ali Abdaal:** Yeah. I think that's so true. It's like uh sometimes i'll i'll get friends asking me like hey you know you're you're into investing like what should i invest my money in and i'm like hmm the easy answer is s&p 500 but yeah i i think that's not actually the answer like what's the goal here let's figure this out and then
