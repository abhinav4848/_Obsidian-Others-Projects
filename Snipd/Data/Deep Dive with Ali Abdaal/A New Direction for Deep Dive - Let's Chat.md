###  [Adapting Podcast Content to Audience Feedback](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5a9da228-60ba-4891-a9bf-06491f2467f6) 

🎧 05:55 - 07:22 (01:27)

The podcast creators decided to shift the content focus based on audience feedback, aiming to add value by tailoring it to what the audience wanted. This involved asking fewer questions based on personal interests and considering the relevance to complete beginners. As a result, the podcast evolved from being a fun personal endeavor to something designed for the audience, with enjoyment becoming a side effect rather than the main reason for doing it. This transition made it feel more like a job, characterized by external gain and happiness becoming a happy side effect. The podcast's growth prompted considerations of expanding by featuring bigger guests and undertaking more activities to align with the overall business growth strategy.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** on the feedback from you guys, based on the feedback from the audience, we were like, okay, cool. We want to add value. Therefore, let's mold the podcast to what the audience wants from us. Let's make it so that I ask fewer questions about things that I'm personally interested in. Because, you know, as it relates to entrepreneurship and build business and run and stuff, I am like now quite far ahead of most people who listen to this podcast, just because I've been doing it for a very long time and been obsessing about it for a very long time. And so a lot of the questions that I want to ask are no longer relevant to a complete beginner, for example. And so the podcast started to change and mold based on the feedback we were getting from the audience. And at a certain point, it crossed from it being a fun thing that I do for fun that we just happened to publish to being a thing that I do for the audience that as a side effect, I sort of have fun doing. And when the enjoyment of it became a side effect, rather than the main reason for doing it, that's when it really started to inch into that territory of feeling like a job. Because really the thing, like what is a job? A job is a thing you do for the sake of some kind of external gain. And the happiness you get out of it is like a happy side effect, broadly. Broadly. You can argue with that definition, but it started to feel like a job for whatever that's worth. at a certain point in business's growth, like indigestion is more likely to kill you than starvation. So with our business, you know, we've got the YouTube channel, we've got the courses, we've got the book. And then we also had the podcast on top of that. And the podcast was growing and growing. And we're thinking, okay, we want to bigger guests. We wanted to do more things, but

###  [Strategic Imbalance Leads to Success](https://share.snipd.com/snip/483ac4e7-7f52-4a5b-9460-55ef3541a921) 

🎧 16:15 - 18:03 (01:48)

Success often requires a period of grind and hustle, but successful and happy individuals recognize when it no longer serves them. Starting a business or pursuing financial independence requires hard work and may lead to imbalance, but it is important to strategically manage this imbalance to avoid burnout and assess the ongoing usefulness of the grind. Achieving work-life balance while starting a successful business may be extremely challenging, and individuals who prioritize work-life balance may find it difficult to succeed in business endeavors.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** One of the key lessons that I've really learned from it is that every successful person, seemingly, has a period of grind and a period of hustle. But then the ones who are happy are the ones who recognize when that period of grind or hustle is no longer serving them. Like to start a business, you kind of have to have that period of grind and hustle. It's very hard to start a business while you have a full-time job if you also want it to be successful and if you also want to have a really good work-life balance. It's just really, really hard to do that. I don't know many people who've been able to do that. But if you're serious about starting a business or a side hustle or becoming financially independent or any of that kind of stuff, it does take a period of hard work where your life might be imbalanced. But what a lot of these people now advise is it's like strategic imbalance. You recognize that in the season of your life, you're in crunch mode and you're going to grind. And you're always keeping an eye on making sure you don't get burned out, making sure you are taking appropriate breaks and making sure that you can sort of bring your head above water so that you can survey the landscape and see, is continuing to grind still useful right now? I was in a bit of a grind phase when I was working full time and also doing the YouTube channel. And I found ways to make it fun as per the whole, like feel-good productivity philosophy. This is like the German version, which happens to be on my desk. Well, I found ways to make it fun, but my work-life balance was not amazing when I was working full-time as a doctor and also, you know, commuting an hour to work and back and also trying to have a social life. And I'm also trying to go to the gym and also trying to grow a YouTube channel and a business. Honestly, not great work-life balance. I was working all the time. It's just the work was really fun. And I found ways to avoid getting burned out. So if you really, really, really, really value work-life balance, you are probably not going to start a successful business. It's just the way of the world. At least that's what I've gleaned from a hundred plus entrepreneurs that I've interviewed on this podcast so far. But

And I've had the privilege to interview a bunch of people sort of on the health front and also on the relationships front here on the podcast. On the health front, honestly, the biggest takeaway I've gotten is find a way to make it easy so that you can be consistent. Something Alex Hormozzi said on the pod was something to the effect of, look, if you can just the gym regularly for like six months or a year, that's all it takes to make it so that you'll do it forever. And doing

###  [Creating Rituals for Health and Relationships](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0843255c-595e-45e6-a855-afa521226b96) 

🎧 22:35 - 23:57 (01:22)

Establishing morning workouts can help busy individuals prioritize their health, while incorporating rituals into relationships, such as regular relationship reviews and scheduled date nights, can contribute to improving relationship health and being more intentional about nurturing relationships.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** whatever you can to make it easy. Like these days I do workouts in the morning and I have a personal trainer and just realizing that, oh, most of these entrepreneur type people who are very busy, they make time to work out in the morning because if you do it in the daytime, it's not going to happen. If you it in the evening, that eats into family time. So mornings are actually a really good time to take care of your health. That's something I've started doing, thanks to advice I've gotten on the podcast. On the relationships front as well, you know, we did a great interview with professors John and Julie Gottman, who do a bunch of, have written a bunch of books about relationships and do research on relationships. And one of the main takeaways for me from that was how kind of the importance of rituals. You know, one thing I do with my girlfriend is, you know, we do regular-ish relationship reviews where we ask each other the same set of 10 questions every time. We've been doing this for years now. And it's great for improving relationship health and for being a little bit more intentional about this thing that's crucial to everyone's lives, relationships um yeah just trying to inject more intentionality into relationships is something that i've really taken away from the podcast because it's it is kind of weird like most people think it's weird to do a relationship review or to have like a regularly scheduled date night where you talk about your finances or something to that effect um but yeah a lot of these like relationship expert and relationships therapists seem to land on that insight that, hey, there is value in the rituals. There is value in doing stuff repeatedly that you know is good for you and creating those rituals as a way to remind you to actually do the thing. Okay.
