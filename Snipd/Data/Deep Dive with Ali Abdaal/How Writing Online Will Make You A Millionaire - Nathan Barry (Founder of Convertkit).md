###  [The Power of Setting Your Own Pace and Pursuing Continuous Growth](https://share.snipd.com/snip/adcaa0bc-6e0b-41bb-99b5-112b73f359c2) 

🎧 00:52 - 01:43 (00:51)

The speaker shares the experience of consistently writing a thousand words a day for 600 days, emphasizing the importance of setting one's own pace and determining the speed of achieving goals.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** wrote a thousand words a day for 600 days in a row. Yeah. What the fuck? I'm never someone that's content to

**Nathan Barry:** go at the same pace as everyone else. You set the pace, right? Do you want this to take multiple years? Sometimes it should, and sometimes it's best for you. Or do you wanna get it done very quickly? That's been probably a defining factor in my life.

**Ali Abdaal:** That's absolutely insane. This week's episode is with Nathan Barry, who's the founder and CEO of ConvertKit, a software company valued at over $100 million.

###  [Earning Potential: Job vs. Business](https://share.snipd.com/snip/401e6a2a-a33c-49ab-acf4-e78fc81e552f) 

🎧 10:25 - 11:46 (01:20)

The common perspective on making money is tied to having a job, where the earnings are limited and closely tied to time. With a business, there is an opportunity to increase earnings to higher levels, such as 50,000, 100,000, or 200,000 a year, by learning the skills to make money within one's own business. This presents a niche way of thinking about making money, distinct from the traditional job-focused approach.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** A lot of people, so it sounds like the way that we're talking about it, right now, it's almost a given that we're talking about having your own business and learning all the skills to making money within your own business. Which I think is also a niche way of thinking about making money because for like 99.99% of the population making money is the that's tied to your job i wonder like what are what are your thoughts on like having a job having a business and i guess in your early days what took you down in that the having a business route rather than the getting a job route well so if you think about the ability to increase

**Nathan Barry:** your earnings in a job you're fairly limited right the default is you're going to get some, um, cost of living increase, right? Three to 5% a year, maybe, um, now it won't outpace inflation, but, uh, you know, or you're going to have to jump roles and level up, right? And we've seen a lot, a lot of people. And I had that in my own career where the first job that I had was making 60,000 a year as a designer, the first professional job. worked at Wendy's doing food service, you know, and plenty of web design and all that as well. But in any job, for the most part, your earnings are going to be very closely tied to your time. And you can't really separate those. And so I wanted to get to the point not where I was making 50,000, 100, 200,000 a year.

###  [Balancing Creativity and Skill Development in a Job](https://share.snipd.com/snip/301b4234-1765-4588-8a3c-40502adc4abb) 

🎧 12:54 - 14:14 (01:19)

The speaker has always been a creator and constantly learning and making things. They worked as a software designer at a startup during an economic downturn, watched the company raise venture capital, and experienced multiple layoffs. During this time, the speaker realized they were losing valued skills and reflected on what they valued about themselves beyond their job.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Nathan Barry:** mean, that's a good question. I think I've always been a creator. I've always made things. And so, yeah, I'm constantly learning and constantly making. And I think I just get really, really bored. And I actually spent two and a half years working as a software designer at this startup. And I had done freelance web design for a couple of years. And then in the beginning of 2009, so at least in the US, the economy was down like crazy. And all my clients like stopped hiring except for this one company. And they, you know, they're like, hey, we have even more work. Actually, do you want to just come on full time? And so I joined them were there for two and a half years. And during that time, I watched them raise a ton of venture capital. I think I was employee 15 and maybe peaked at 70 or 80 employees. And then they did a few rounds of layoffs and you know, I eventually left. Um, but that was something I remember going through that process and finding that I was losing a lot of the skills that I valued about myself, right? I think it's really interesting if you were to write down, like, what do you value about yourself? And there's probably some things, you know, like how you are as a friend and other things that are, like, really good.

###  [Self-paced Learning and Efficiency](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5835127d-c7d9-4dd2-9ba4-68e3732f3ed6) 

🎧 20:31 - 21:49 (01:18)

The speaker's mother provided a flexible homeschooling curriculum that allowed the speaker to set the pace for their high school education, enabling them to complete the curriculum and graduate high school earlier than usual. The speaker combined long drives with math lessons, making good use of time and finishing the high school curriculum by the age of 15. This experience emphasizes the concept of self-paced learning and the efficiency of combining activities to achieve academic goals.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Nathan Barry:** so it's basically the same question that I asked her or that she had brought up about, you know, math homework on a snowy day, but applied to a bigger chunk of time. And, you know, she had homeschooled my older siblings who had already finished high school. And, and so she said, no, I have the exact curriculum, you know, that you're going to go through. You can graduate high school whenever you complete this curriculum. And so I remember thinking that we would do these drives from Boise to Seattle, which is about eight or nine hours to go visit family every summer. And that was before iPads and all of that. And so I remember thinking like, I'm really bored on this drive and I'm really bored when I do math. So why don't I just combine these two? And I would do like a month's worth of math lessons on a drive over to Seattle. And I had my older brother sitting next to me and, you know, whenever I got stuck, he could help me and we'd go through that. And so from when I was 13 to when I was 15, I finished all of the like high school curriculum. And then I graduated just a little before turning 16. And then I was off going to college and all of that. So really the idea of you set the pace. Derek Sivers talks about this in his book, Anything You Want, how he went through Berklee School of Music

###  [Setting the Pace and Fixed Work vs. Fixed Time](https://share.snipd.com/snip/276db741-4064-417c-b118-f951742005fc) 

🎧 21:35 - 22:46 (01:11)

The speaker emphasizes the concept of setting the pace in one's education, inspired by Derek Sivers' experience at Berkeley School of Music. They stress the importance of deciding whether to take multiple years or get things done quickly. Additionally, the idea of fixed work versus fixed time is highlighted, where at certain jobs, the work is fixed and will always be there, regardless of how quickly it is completed.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Nathan Barry:** then I graduated just a little before turning 16. And then I was off going to college and all of that. So really the idea of you set the pace. Derek Sivers talks about this in his book, Anything You Want, how he went through Berklee School of Music very, very quickly because of this one professor that was like, let me teach you a semester's worth of music theory in like two days. And Derek talks about how like the class goes at the pace of the slowest student. And sometimes that's you and sometimes that's someone else and it changes based on every topic, but like averages out, it's going to be quite slow. And so I've just always been obsessed with this idea of you set the pace, right? Do you want this to take multiple years? Sometimes it should, and sometimes it's the best for you. Or do you want to get it done very quickly? And yeah, that's been probably a defining factor in my life.

**Ali Abdaal:** That's so good. I was just taking, I was,

**Nathan Barry:** I feel like I had so many kind of brainwaves as

**Ali Abdaal:** you were saying that. I think this, this idea of fixed work versus fixed time is really important. Because if you're, if you're, for example, working at Wendy's, that's fixed time. Like, you know, the work is always going to be there. It's not like if you work faster you can then put your feet up i suspect right but

###  [Finding Happiness and Fulfillment in Work and Life Balance](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2f49b2e4-041e-4c84-8eca-a15e5b8a6dfe) 

🎧 25:59 - 27:13 (01:13)

The goal is to find happiness, contentment, and meaning, whether it's through a fulfilling day job and hobbies, or through a side hustle to address dissatisfaction with the current job. Some individuals feel stifled and seek additional income for liberation and freedom, while others find contentment in enjoying their job and personal life without the need for a side hustle. Starting a business may be a reasonable option for those feeling their job is not helping them reach their potential.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** is happiness, contentment, and meaning. The goal is not have a $100 million business. And if you get happiness, contentment, and meaning from the day job which you really enjoy and then you go home and do stuff on the side and like have hobbies and have work-life balance and that is absolutely fantastic that is what we're all trying to strive towards in some way or another um but equally i speak to a lot of my a lot of people i know who have the day job and they're not content. They're like, oh, I'm feeling my skills are being stifled. I'm feeling like I'm losing a bit of myself. I used to have all these interests when I was a kid and then they got squashed out of me by the education system, etc. Yeah, I'm capable

**Nathan Barry:** of more.

**Ali Abdaal:** And those people feel like, oh, you know, if only I could have an extra 3K, 5K a month of passive income something like, oh my God, that would be so liberating. It would buy my freedom. Whereas there are people in my team, as much as I encourage people to have side hustles, you know, Alison, I head of customer success, is like, I don't want a side hustle. I just want to chill. I enjoy my job. I enjoy my team. I get home from work and then I hang out with my friends and I go see musicals in London. And I'm like, great. She's like one of the happiest people I know. But I think it's that thing around like, if you're complaining about your situation, starting a business might actually be a reasonable option if you do feel like your job is not helping you reach your potential.

###  [Achieving Success through Strategic Book Launch and Sales Tactics](https://share.snipd.com/snip/889c21b1-36f2-49c5-8132-a93229e1b679) 

🎧 52:38 - 53:59 (01:20)

The speaker wrote a book, launch emails, and a blog post to summarize the launch. Leveraging their expertise in web design, they wrote another book about designing web applications by maintaining a habit of writing thousand words a day. The book generated $26,000 in sales on the first day and $50,000 in the first month. The speaker targeted one-day sales due to inspiration from Chris Gillibo's article about hitting $100,000 in sales in a single day from a course launch.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Nathan Barry:** the book. I wrote all the launch emails. I wrote a blog post summarizing how the launch went. Like, what else would I write? And then I thought, I mean, I know web design. And specifically web software design really well, because that's what I did for years. It's like, okay, let me write a book about that. Let me follow a similar habit or similar pattern. And so then I wrote a book called Designing Web Applications. It didn't take that long to write because I wrote a thousand words a day. And so 90 days later, I published it. The email list was up to a couple thousand people at that point. I ended up doing $26,000 in sales of that book in the first day. Nice. 50,000 in the first month. Something that I just realized, someone asked me this years ago and I didn't have an answer for it, but I just made a little connection of why I targeted one day sales. Because it's like, okay, why does the first day of sales matter? Especially because I have this big spike because I would offer like a 20% off discount if you the first day and then that would go away. And then there'd be sales tapering off. Uh, Chris Gillibow in one of his articles talked about how he hit a hundred thousand dollars in sales in a single day from a course launch. And I think that always stuck with me of like the one day thing. And I like designed my launches around a single day number, even

###  [Writing Process and Word Tracking with Scrivener](https://share.snipd.com/snip/07458691-3a66-47d2-a7ce-d168e8dcbff9) 

🎧 59:03 - 01:00:28 (01:25)

The speaker effortlessly hits a thousand words while writing their newsletter, often ending up with 2000 words that need to be trimmed down. They used Scrivener to set word count goals and track progress, organizing the content into individual pages and folders based on an outline. The app allowed them to monitor daily and total progress, categorize the content, and mark titles that lacked substantial content with an asterisk.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Ali Abdaal:** when I do write and I'm typing away, find myself effortlessly hitting a thousand because it's actually not that many words and when i write my newsletter i'm like oh shit this was two thousand words better cut some of it down and i'm curious what did for you what did this process of a thousand words a day like what what app were you using where were you writing how did you figure out what you were going to write about like where did the inspiration each day come from? How did that work? Well, it weirdly, like the requirement was that it had,

**Nathan Barry:** the app I wrote in had to have really good word tracking because that was the word count. And so I used Scrivener because that was the app at the time that was the best at having like individual pages almost. Yeah. But then would be summarized well. It could be compiled total. And so Scrivener let you set a goal like, hey, I want this book to be 35,000 words. And it would tell you both your daily progress and your total progress against that across all of the like pages down the side. So you could organize it and categorize the whole thing. So I wrote in Scrivener. I would, if I, when I was writing a book, I would write an outline for it. And then I would take that outline and make folders and empty pages for each title within it. And I would put an asterisk at the beginning of the title if I like hadn't written anything meaningful for it. So

###  [The Power of Transcription and Daily Writing Habits](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b62ce482-2472-4bed-ab0d-865c6d77ea18) 

🎧 01:02:24 - 01:03:38 (01:14)

Using transcription can help in organizing thoughts and generating content ideas. Developing a habit of daily writing, even if it initially seems like nonsense, can lead to significant progress towards various goals, including content creation and wealth generation.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Nathan Barry:** right? But, you know, if you're just trying to talk to yourself. so using now transcription stuff is really good and so like just talk on the topic i'll do that when i'm in the car i'll just start a voice memo and then be like okay what do i have to say about audience building you know or like whatever the topic is and then i'm like uh okay and then what about this and here's a story and it's all like nonsense but then you transcribe it and you you through it. And like, okay, that's a whole thing to write on. So it's this. And then you rewrite it and you get the stories and the structure and all of that. But it's pretty straightforward. You just have to force yourself to

**Ali Abdaal:** do it. But the habit compounds in a ridiculous way. This is good shit. I'm feeling so inspired right now i feel like if i if i could if i actually sat down and wrote a thousand words per day that would be the single thing that would drive me most towards like literally every single goal that i'm working on right and even goals that i don't even know i have right now because they're all around content sharing my thoughts content creation, writing, making videos. When getting clear on all of these ideas.

###  [The Power of Writing to Understand and Teach Concepts](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4d672d54-949c-4843-9164-074d71f43530) 

🎧 01:03:30 - 01:04:55 (01:24)

The speaker explores how writing helps them understand concepts and teaches them to others. They believe that writing forces them to unpack intuitive knowledge and observations, enabling a deeper understanding of concepts. They emphasize the importance of teaching everything one knows, regardless of perceived expertise, and advocate for the idea that people become perceived as experts because they teach, not the other way around.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Nathan Barry:** talked about these flagship essays that I like to work on. I three. Lotters of Wealth Creation, Billion Dollar Creator, and then the Creator Flywheels. These are all on things that I generally know to be true. I'm like, yeah, this is how wealth is built, but I can't quite explain it. And so through writing, I get obsessive about how do you explain this? Why, why does this work in a certain way? You know, and then it turns into this thing to get to where I understand the concepts well enough that I can truly teach it. And that's what I, what I love with writing is finding all the things that you intuitively know to be true or observe in the world. And then someone's like, okay, why is that? And you're like, uh, it just is, you know? And, and that really takes you into like writing forces you to unpack that. And then one of my mantras in life is teach everything you know, because that turns into, we have this idea that only experts can teach. And the main principle behind my book, Authority, is that we don't, people don't teach because they're experts. We perceive them as experts because they teach, right? It's chicken and egg and we have it backwards. Um, and so in that, if you step into a world where you're like, okay, I'm just going to teach what I learned today, then you build the habit and you write

###  [The Challenges of Establishing a Daily Writing Habit](https://share.snipd.com/snip/55421db7-5b72-4901-a4b7-6a57392bd204) 

🎧 01:20:01 - 01:21:24 (01:23)

Establishing a habit of writing 1000 words a day is a simple but not easy task. It has the potential to change one's life, but requires significant dedication and prioritization. Despite experiencing setbacks such as illness, the speaker acknowledges the transformative power of this habit and the need to design one's day and week around it. Struggling with sporadic writing, the speaker emphasizes the difference between simplicity and ease, highlighting the necessity of making writing a top priority and committing to its difficulty in order to succeed.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Nathan Barry:** know so even saying that right i did it for 600 days in a row uh i actually ended up getting shingles after that and so that's sometimes people ask like well why aren't you at like 1200 days in a row now it's like well i ended up getting really sick and took me like six months to recover and all that but i guess the way to put it is it is simple but not easy

**Ali Abdaal:** and

**Nathan Barry:** so yes writing a thousand words a day will absolutely change your life. And that is a very simple thing, but it is not easy to do. And you have to design your day and your week around that habit. And that has to become one of the non-negotiables. And that's something that honestly I've struggled with, right? As I go back and forth between, you know, building a team and scaling and all of that, I know that all of my goals would be furthered by writing a thousand words a day. And I still write fairly sporadically right now. Like I haven't rebuilt that. And I think it's because we say things to ourselves like, oh, this should be easy. And because we're conflating, simple and easy. It is very simple and it is not at all easy and so if you get clear with yourself that like okay i am setting out to do something that is in fact very difficult and i have to design my day around and my week around making sure that this can happen and this has to become my number one priority in my business then at that point you can actually make it happen but if you're like oh this this will be really easy i'll just knock it out and then move on

###  [Strategic Acquisition of Audio Rights](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1b7d206c-6fb7-4b22-92c9-c4af4aa3f5fc) 

🎧 01:23:38 - 01:24:59 (01:20)

The speaker discusses how a person initially sold the audio rights to their book, bought them back for $10,000 and then self-published it through Audible, making $50,000 to $60,000 a month. This success led Tim Ferriss to strategically buy the undervalued audio rights to various books, capitalizing on their potential when the market undervalued them.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Nathan Barry:** so then they sold it to somebody else. And then it kind of bounced around. And then they were going, like, he was like, I don't like this and so he asked can i buy them back and so for like ten thousand dollars or something he bought back the audio rights the personal mba uh published it himself through audible audible had this crazy distribution thing where like the more copies you sold the higher percentage you got of every copy sold and it ended up it got to the point that at one point josh was making like 50 to 60 000 a month uh off of exclusively the audio version of the personal mba nice tim ferris understood this and started going around buying the audio rights to any book where the audio rights weren't valued so um you have the obstacles away on your shelf uh tim ferris owns the audio Rights. Oh, I would have to know that. The Obstacle is the Way. And he did this for a whole bunch of books. Yeah.

**Ali Abdaal:** And- Do like the Seneca Letters, one of the Stoicism Letters? Letters from Stoic, yeah. That's the one, yeah.

**Nathan Barry:** Yeah, so he's done it for really a lot because there was this moment in time where audio rights were radically undervalued for what they got. And so it made me think, like listening to that episode, one, I had been around, like I knew Tim and I knew Ryan back then. And so I remember talking to, like I remember hearing that and seeing it all unfold. But

###  [Creating a Paid Newsletter to Segment the Audience](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8920ad42-65dc-4a72-baa0-44a84f38a2e8) 

🎧 01:38:02 - 01:39:20 (01:18)

The speaker created a paid newsletter called 'secret money newsletter' as a barrier to entry for a different audience segment. The newsletter is priced at $100 as a one-time fee and is delivered as an email course. It allowed the speaker to write to a different audience without caveats, specifying that it is not for those making less than $200,000 a year or for anyone who hesitates about the $100 price tag. This approach has been enjoyable for the speaker and has allowed for segmentation of the audience.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Nathan Barry:** I wanted to write about that topic, but I knew that's not what you write about to a 50,000 person, 30,000 person email list. And so what I did is I said, okay, I'm going to create my own paid newsletter. It's only paid so that there's a little bit of a barrier to get into it. I don't really care about the money from it, but I called it my secret money newsletter. And I said, it's a hundred bucks one time to get on the list rather than committing to like writing every single week. I made an email course. And so I started it when I had like six emails written out and you'd get one every Friday. And then whenever I felt inspired, I'd add another one. It's now 17 emails long and people just get all the emails and they wait at the end until I added another one and then it'll be 18 and so on from there. But it let me write to a different audience without the caveats. Cause I just said like, look, if you're making less than 200,000 a year, this is not for you. If you thought for even a second about is a hundred dollars worth buying this thing, this is not for you. Uh, and it's been so much fun because I segmented my audience and I'm talking about like, okay, what are your favorite things you've ever splurged on? Right? Like a VIP tour at Disneyland for like your family and friends. One

🎧 01:38:02 - 01:39:20 (01:18)

The speaker wanted to write about a specific topic to a smaller, more targeted audience than their 50,000 person email list. They decided to create a paid newsletter called 'secret money newsletter' which people could join for $100. The newsletter was essentially an email course, with new content being added whenever inspiration struck. The speaker used this platform to connect with a different segment of their audience, setting clear criteria for who the newsletter was intended for. By doing this, the speaker was able to engage in more focused and enjoyable conversations with their audience.

###  [Maximizing Revenue and Enterprise Value](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6b52ca91-eaa1-4eff-b583-1954b193f7ee) 

🎧 02:09:15 - 02:10:41 (01:25)

Entrepreneurs should consider the average revenue per user when choosing between consumer apps and agency services, as the latter can generate higher average revenue per user. The choice between maximizing enterprise value or cash flow depends on individual goals, with agencies offering a better model for cash flow. It's also possible to run multiple agencies without it being a huge drain on time, as demonstrated by successful entrepreneurs.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Nathan Barry:** but after seeing like behind the scenes of some of these services businesses that are doing like 10 to 20 million a year in profit then you're like oh okay so what's really interesting about that is a lot of products you end up with a low average revenue per user so if we take your um productivity consumer app yeah if we would be a low average revenue per user yeah so you might be making a hundred dollars per year per user yeah something like that right that's very different than if we're charging $10,000 a month for an agency service. That's $100,000 average revenue per user. And so it takes really a lot of individual app subscriptions to add up to even a handful of the agency subscriptions. And so it really depends on your goals right if you're trying to maximize enterprise value basically that the equity value of what you could sell this for then you might really focus on the app side but if you're trying to maximize you know cash flow both short and long term then the agency could be a much better model and then especially realizing that they're not mutually exclusive this is something that solio bloom is very good at right where he's saying oh i'm going to start this and this and this and he asked the question like what would have to be true for me to be able to run multiple agencies without that being a huge drain on my time right like for

###  [Building a $100 Million Business from a Niche Blog](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fc4aefac-2846-4aa1-9086-3a5e233a304a) 

🎧 02:12:06 - 02:13:33 (01:26)

The example of Mark Sisson demonstrates the potential to grow a niche blog into a $100 million business. By expanding beyond blogging, he launched a successful company called Primal Kitchen, offering products that fit the Paleo diet. Leveraging his existing audience and email newsletter, he initially drove sales and then expanded to grocery store distribution. This strategy showcases the potential for significant business growth from a niche blog by diversifying into related products and leveraging audience reach.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Nathan Barry:** what I wonder is, could you build a $100 million business? So an example that I love is this guy, Mark Sisson, who he created a blog called Mark's Daily Apple, maybe 2009, 2010 time period. And if you about when the paleo diet um started to really become popular they were focused on uh recipes and content in that niche and he built this blog to the point that i think it was making over a million dollars a year which is just absolutely incredible and you might think like okay that's the pinnacle of what you can do with a blog. And what Mark ended up doing is he said, what else can I offer to this community? And so we thought like, wouldn't it be really nice if you could have a, um, like a mayonnaise or a ketchup or the things that match the paleo diet. And so he started his own company making that called Primal Kitchen and, you know, got his recipes, manufactured, all of that, and used his audience, you know, of a couple hundred thousand people on an email newsletter in this niche to like drive his first sales. And then as it went from there, he was trying to get distribution in grocery stores. And I don't know the exact details, but I imagine what happened is things like getting in Whole Foods for the very first time. They're like, sure, we'll see if people buy this. We'll give you one bit of placement in this one store in Austin, right? Well, what

###  [Harnessing the Flywheel Effect for Business Growth](https://share.snipd.com/snip/73416fc5-f3db-407b-922d-311c8ec14bb1) 

🎧 02:25:49 - 02:27:13 (01:24)

The flywheel effect implies that with each rotation, it produces more, making tasks easier over time. This principle can be applied to business by creating a flywheel around content ideas, leading to increased efficiency and productivity. By utilizing the flywheel effect, businesses can streamline processes, generate more ideas, and improve customer interactions for sustained growth and scale.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Nathan Barry:** the third thing is every time every rotation it actually produces more and in an abstract business sense you're like this is too good to be true you're saying this gets easier with time and produces more that's insane but it actually works in real life physics right and i i know firsthand of how hard that was to turn at first and how little water I got. And then by the end, I'm just standing there spinning it one hand. It's so easy. So I'm now absolutely obsessed with, uh, with flywheels of how can I apply this all throughout my business and how can I help creators apply this? So I want to both on a very small scale and then on a very large scale. Let's take, for example, writing a newsletter every week. On one hand, it's not that hard. On the other hand, you're like, shoot, what do I even write about? And if you're working through a list of ideas or it's scattered, then you're like, you're trying to figure, it's Monday night, the newsletter goes out Tuesday morning You're like, what should I even write about? I'm running out of ideas. If you have a flywheel around content ideas, then it can completely change the game. So let's say that if we map out this flywheel, new people are signing up for my newsletter and I send them a few welcome emails. And like in the third or fourth welcome email, I ask them a question. And I say, hey, what is your biggest frustration with learning to scale your YouTube
