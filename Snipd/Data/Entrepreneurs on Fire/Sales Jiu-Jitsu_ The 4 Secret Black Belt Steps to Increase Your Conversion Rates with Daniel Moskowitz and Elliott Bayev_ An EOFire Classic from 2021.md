###  [A Gentle Art: The Synergy Between Jiu-Jitsu and Modern Sales](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ffb53edb-3352-40d3-a1b5-ea2bbe87e597) [[Processed]]

🎧 03:14 - 04:06 (00:52)

The author runs a training program called Mastermind BJJ and noticed a connection between the philosophy of jiu-jitsu and sales. They believe jiu-jitsu is a gentle art and sales should not be combative. The book's philosophy is about overcoming obstacles in helping clients and not fighting against them.

#### 📚 Transcript

We know that only old-school martial art or only old-school sales is combative, the bull head mentality. Modern sales is much more collaborative, care, and service-based. And jiu-jitsu, as a martial art, you could say, is the most gentle of all the arts. Literally translated, jiu-jitsu means art of softness or gentle art. And there just seem to be so much synergy between the way Daniel approaches sales and the way I teach jiu-jitsu. And the philosophy of the book is, we're not fighting the client, obviously. We're fighting the forces that get in the way of them saying yes to letting us help them.

Yeah, it was amazing to me when I was sitting there as a student and Elliot would come up with some way of teaching us a move.

###  [Implementing Sparring Partners for Real World Scenarios in sales](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ec0ac44f-9fc1-45a3-8038-8c415c713071) [[Processed]]

🎧 10:44 - 12:06 (01:21)

Implemented sparring partners - team members become each other's real-world scenarios, facing obstacles they couldn't overcome. It becomes an engaging and uplifting experience, not just role playing. Tools are created to log training sessions and extract learnings, which are then shared across the organization.

🔒 Private note: The best way to overcome a problem in sales is to pretend that one partner is the client and the other partner is to salesman. Then salesman has to try to negotiate the sale while the other partner opposes.

#### 📚 Transcript

So what I implemented was the idea of sparring partners, taking real world scenarios. So what I did was in a specific week, my team are paired up together. And they are mandated in their calendar to, as sparring partners, to now go and take a real world scenario that they had that week, something that they actually could not overcome and become that person for the other person. They become their own prospect that they couldn't overcome. And they now spar with their sparring partner. And that real resistance, that actual real world scenario, that week with whatever we were pushing that week, whatever the the deal was that week. And it doesn't become this like chore of like dead role playing. It becomes a real alive element that just lifts everybody up. And then from that, we created tools that allow them to not only log that training session, but then we take the the learnings from that and put them into things like objection handling databases, niche specific overcome objections, so that we have they have learnings that come out of the sparring sessions that enable us to have disseminate the learning across the organization. And we've actually provided these tools as part of the

book.

###  [The Cost of Inaction](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e65bdd23-f6ce-47cc-bbcb-3ff0c3456d1b) [[Processed]]

🎧 19:22 - 20:33 (01:11)

To improve your chances of approval, consider who else needs to be involved early on. Set up the win by getting the customer to state the cost of inaction. This will help prevent objections and ensure the deal doesn't slip through your fingers.

🔒 Private note: Make the client themselves tell you what will happen if the problem persists. This way you can sell your business to them better

#### 📚 Transcript

The last is set up the win. Have you ever gotten to a part in a close and you've closed the deal and the next day you get a phone call and you're like, that the deal just isn't going to go through. It's it's they've they've gotten to a point where you got an objection that came out of the woodwork that you could not handle. So what I'm about to teach you now is a bulletproof way to make sure a deal does not slip through your fingers. So you could get not get into a bulletproof way to make sure that you do not get an objection you can't handle. So it's called setting up your win. And the idea here is the cost of inaction. What most people do is ignore the cost of inaction or the state of the cost of inaction for a customer. So what you should be doing is making the customer state the cost of inaction themselves. So what would be what would be what would happen if the problem that you solve does not get solved. And it can't be you telling them this. It has to be them telling you because when you get this wording right and you feed it back to them at any point in the conversation, it can essentially bulletproof you against any

objection.
