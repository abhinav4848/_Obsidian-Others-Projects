###  [The Power of Pre-Framing and Story-Based Testimonials](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b4fe2200-2bf0-4edf-981d-867dce509e32) 

🎧 04:07 - 05:44 (01:36)

1. Pre-framing is a tool for influencing others by being precise with words and actions.
2. A power drill is a more effective tool than a rusty hammer for precise tasks.
3. Pre-framing involves using story-based testimonials to illustrate desired outcomes.

#### 📚 Transcript

Yes. Exactly. And if you're listening to this right now and you notice something that we talk about going back and forth today that will make a big difference in your life, your audience to take action on that, right? Absolutely. Absolutely. That's pre-framing. That pre-framing, right? That pre-framing is creating an influencing tool and having that influencing tooling a toolbox. So for example, if you wanted to put a new screw in the wall to hang up that beautiful picture of you and Kate when you just got engaged, right? Would you be using a rusty hammer or would you use a power drill? Power drill all the way. Right. And you'd use that drill because it's more precise, right? You can use the drill and screw exactly where you want it to go rather than just trying to beat it with a hammer and hope it goes in the right direction. So what pre-framing is all about is being precise with the words and the actions that you use before you want someone to take that next step. So what you want, you want to do something like this, right? So for example, we had a client recently and they sent me this video of her screaming at the laptop because she just couldn't believe the results. And this client, she told me on average, it takes a six months for someone to buy some products off her list, right? Six months. Imagine waiting six months to go what you want. And she was actually shocked that on the very first launch we did with her, she reduced that buying cycle down to seven days. Now what I just did there is actually give you an example of a story based testimonial, rather than just going, Hey, this person went from there to there. Right.

###  [Maximizing Customer Value with Free Trials and Upsells](https://share.snipd.com/snip/81ae4927-9c63-4d27-892d-ab21a37076e8) 

🎧 15:44 - 17:26 (01:42)

1. Customers who have just made a high-ticket purchase are more likely to take advantage of a free trial or subscription offer
2. Using a free trial method on order bumps and upsells can increase conversion rates by 30% to 80%
3. Offer hot buyers the opportunity to make additional purchases
4. Guide customers back to upsells through various platforms to increase lifetime customer value
5. If an upsell is presented as a one-time offer, it should be honored as such
6. Increasing the number of offers increases the likelihood of achieving desired outcomes

#### 📚 Transcript

Exactly. Now, imagine your customers come through the same thing with your webinar. You're getting registered, you've got them excited, you've got to the pitchy product, they're all in, you've done really well, you've sold them that $1,000 or $2,000 product, and then that's it. The customer was literally biting your hand off to say, what else do you have? A lot of people have got nothing for them. Now, if someone just bought something for $1,000, what's the chances that they're going to take advantage of a 30-day free trial that maybe leads into a $97 a month subscription? It's pretty high. In fact, we do this with a lot of clients, and we're seeing between 30% and 80% conversion rate when using a free trial method on order bumps and upsells off the back of a high ticket course. That could put an extra 30 to 40% on your bottom line by just doing this one thing. Here's the thing. If you've got a hot buyer, give a hot buyer the opportunity to be a hot buyer. Another thing you can do to bring people back into increase that lifetime customer value is actually guide people back to those upsells over the next 30 days through email, SMS, messenger, all the different platforms, all those more platforms together. One of the things you need to note on that is if you're going to call an upsell a one-time offer, then really, if you're going to be ethical, you need to make it a one-time offer. That's why if you're actually positioning it as a special offer, then you can come back to it and revisit it or reposition it. It's kind of like archery. If you're going to shoot more arrows at the board, you're more likely to hit the target.
