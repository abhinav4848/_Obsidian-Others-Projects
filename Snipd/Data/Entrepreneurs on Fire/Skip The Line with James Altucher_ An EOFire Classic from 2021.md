###  [Gatekeepers' Advice: Start a Daily Podcast?](https://share.snipd.com/snip/faa2a2ac-6e23-486b-bf33-ef5e54ad2eda) 

🎧 07:02 - 08:07 (01:05)

Despite being advised against it, John decided to start a daily podcast interviewing entrepreneurs. He was told to do what everyone else was doing and have a weekly show, but he wanted to improve his skills and put in the necessary practice. John believed that repetition was key to becoming good at something and was determined to prove the gatekeepers wrong.

#### 📚 Transcript

One hundred percent, James. I mean, listen, this oftentimes, Fire Nation, the gatekeepers to there are the ones that are kind of poo pooing at being like, Oh, you can't do that. Like, no, there's a process you have to go through like, no, you just got to get in the back of the line. And I heard that over and over again when I was deciding to start my first daily podcast interviewing entrepreneurs. And these were from the OGs. These are from the gatekeepers. This is from Cliff Ravenscraft, the podcast mastermind. This is even from our dear friend, Jamie Masters, who was my one on one mentor. Guess what? They wanted the best for me. And they gave me 99% brilliant advice that I did follow, but they were both adamant that, John, you cannot do a daily podcast interviewing entrepreneurs, you will fail. Just do what everybody else is doing. Get in the back of the line, do a once a week show. That's what everybody does. That's what you need to do as well. So get in the back of the line and just put in your reps and over time. Hey, maybe it's going to happen. But I said to myself, does anybody get good at something doing it once a week or four times a month? Like I got to put in the reps. I'm a bad interviewer. I'm a bad podcast host right now.
