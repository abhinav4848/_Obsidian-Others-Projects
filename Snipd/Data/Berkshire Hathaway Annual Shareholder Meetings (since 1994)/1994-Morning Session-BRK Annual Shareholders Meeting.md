###  [Retaining Talented Managers](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3c531ca2-7eda-4464-a215-d61b2f3caa8c) 

🎧 31:24 - 32:41 (01:16)

Retaining skilled managers involves identifying them, ensuring they have reasons beyond financial independence to work, and keeping them interested by providing a compelling reason to stay within the organization.

#### 📚 Transcript

Hi there. My name is Liam from Palo Alto, California. In meeting Ajit Jay and I've been very impressed over the years. I think I even met his parents once. They came from India. Please comment on your deepest impressions of his personality and managerial skills and also how you go about exactly keeping somebody with such fine skills within the fold. He might go to Walt Disney someday and pull down 200 million.

Well, he gets off for 200 million. We may not be competing too vigorously at that level. We basically try to run a business so that Charlie and I have two jobs. We have to identify and keep good managers interested after we figure out who they are. That often is a little different here because I would say a majority of our managers are financially independent so that they don't go to work because they are worried about putting kids through school or putting food on the table. So they have to have some reason to go to work aside from that.

###  [Fed's Job and Influence on Interest Rates](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8c985342-197d-4f3e-b821-3a69cc24d302) 

🎧 48:06 - 49:08 (01:02)

The Federal Reserve's job is to manage interest rates by taking necessary actions to prevent economic overheating. Mr. Greenspan's approach to raising interest rates is seen as sound to prevent speculative bubbles. Influencing the chairman of the Fed like Greenspan is considered challenging, as their actions aim to control economic fluctuations and balance market dynamics.

#### 📚 Transcript

Buffett,

are you interested in influencing Mr. Greenspan at the Fed to stop raising interest rates?

Well, I wouldn't have any influence with him. He was on the Board of Cap City some years ago and I know a little bit but I don't think anyone would have any influence with Mr. Greenspan on that point. But I generally think that his actions

have

been quite sound during his period as Fed Chief. I mean, it's part of the job of the Fed as Mr. Martin said many years ago is to take away the punch pole at the party occasionally. And that's a very difficult policy to quantify working with markets day by day. Of course, it's always been the job of the Fed basically to lean against the wind, which of course means if the wind changes, you fall flat on your face. But that's another question. But the, I don't, I think what he has done has probably been somewhat appropriate.

###  [Make decisions independently](https://share.snipd.com/snip/88ca3e5a-0ade-446e-a35b-530dd71b9718) 

🎧 50:13 - 51:40 (01:26)

The intrinsic value of a company like Berkshire Hathaway can be subjective, and individuals in the securities market will have differing opinions on its valuation. It is important not to base investment decisions on public opinion or market trends but instead to evaluate businesses independently to achieve success in the stock market.

#### 📚 Transcript

Yeah, there was an article about a week or so ago in Beren's. The same fellow wrote an article about four years ago reaching pretty much the same conclusion and I hope he hasn't been short in between. I would say this, it's not the way I would calculate the intrinsic value of Berkshire. But everyone in securities markets makes choices on that. Every day somebody sells a few shares of Berkshire and someone buys and they are probably coming to differing opinions about valuation. I would say that I found it

strange that apparently

he forgot we were an insurance business but that's not all. It really doesn't make any difference. We don't pay any attention to what people say about Coca-Cola stock or Gillette stock or any of those things. On any given day two million shares of Coca-Cola may trade. That's a lot of people selling, a lot of people buying it. If you talk to one person you'd hear one thing and talk to another. You really should not make decisions and securities based on what other people think. If you're doing that you should think about doing something else because a public opinion of poll will not get you rich in Wall Street. So you really want to stick with businesses that you feel you can somehow evaluate yourself.

###  [Make Investment Decisions Independently](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8452f36f-f129-4ab6-88e5-8858c61f7115) 

🎧 50:44 - 52:10 (01:26)

Relying on public opinion or analyst reports for investment decisions is not advisable as it will not lead to wealth. To succeed in investing, focus on evaluating businesses independently rather than being swayed by external factors. Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger emphasize that making decisions based on popular sentiment is not a path to financial success; instead, invest in businesses you can evaluate yourself and disregard external noise.

#### 📚 Transcript

I would say that I found it

strange that apparently

he forgot we were an insurance business but that's not all. It really doesn't make any difference. We don't pay any attention to what people say about Coca-Cola stock or Gillette stock or any of those things. On any given day two million shares of Coca-Cola may trade.

If you're doing that you should think about doing something else because a public opinion of poll will not get you rich in Wall Street. So you really want to stick with businesses that you feel you can somehow evaluate yourself. I mean Charlie and I, we don't read anything about what the economy is going to do or the market is going to do or what anybody, anytime I see some article that says these analysts say this or that about some business, it doesn't mean anything to us. You cannot get rich with a weather vane. Zone seven.

###  [Simplicity in Investment Understanding](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8bef57ca-974c-4cdd-bdba-bdc00624e00f) 

🎧 01:20:16 - 01:21:39 (01:23)

Understanding the future prospects of companies like Nike and Reebok is challenging as the speaker lacks insight into their competitive position and long-term sustainability. While not expressing a negative view, the speaker admits to not comprehending these businesses as well as their current holdings. The speaker prefers businesses with simpler dynamics to evaluate and understands, rather than complex ones like Nike and Reebok. Some businesses are inherently easier to comprehend than others, and the speaker and Charlie prefer investing in companies that are easier to understand rather than dealing with intricate problems.

#### 📚 Transcript

you about the future prospects of Nike and Reebok yeah I I don't know that much about those businesses we do have one person this audience at least who owns a lot of the Reebok but I I'm not expressing a negative view in any way on that I just I don't understand that the I don't understand their competitive position and the likelihood of permanence of their competitive position over a 10 or 20 year period as well as I think I understand the position of brown and extra that doesn't mean I think that it's inferior doesn't mean that I think that we've got better businesses or anything I think we've got very good businesses but I I'm not I'm not I haven't done the work and I'm not sure if I did the work I would understand them I think they are harder to understand frankly and to develop a fix on them than than our kinds but they may be easier for other people who just have a better insight into that kind of business some businesses are a lot easier to understand than others and Charlie and I don't like difficult problems I mean we if something is is hard to figure you know we we'd rather multiply by three than by pie I mean it's just easier for us Charlie and I

###  [The Folly of Relying on Projections](https://share.snipd.com/snip/60ec89e6-1821-4563-90dd-aceab7b3e096) 

🎧 01:23:56 - 01:25:32 (01:36)

Relying on projections when buying a business is viewed as intrinsically dangerous as they are often seen as misleading and unreliable. Warren Buffet and his hero Mark Twain avoided looking at projections, as they considered them to be worthless and potentially harmful. Buffet emphasizes the importance of forming one's own assessment of the future instead of relying on projections made by sellers or their agents, as it can be naive and unproductive. A poignant metaphor used is 'don't ask the barber whether you need a haircut' to highlight the folly of trusting projections provided by sellers of businesses.

#### 📚 Transcript

there's some things that are so intrinsically dangerous another of my heroes is Mark Twain who looked at the promoters of his day and he said a mine is a hole in the ground owned by a liar and that's the way I've come to look at projections basically I can remember Warren and I were offered two million dollars worth of projections once and of course of buying a business and the book was this thick and for nothing and we were given it for nothing and it wouldn't open it

you know we'd almost pay two million not to look at it it's ridiculous I do not understand why any buyer of a business looks at a bunch of projections put together by a seller or or as agent or as agent you can almost say that it's naive to think that that has any utility whatsoever we just are not interested if we don't have some idea ourselves of what we think the future is to sit there and listen to some other guy who's trying to sell us the business or got a commission on it the future is going to be like I say it's very

naive and five years out we

had a line

in the report one time don't ask the barber whether you need a haircut and it's quite applicable to projections of by sellers of businesses zone three
