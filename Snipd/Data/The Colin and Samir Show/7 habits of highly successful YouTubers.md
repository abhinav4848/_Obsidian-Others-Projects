## Snips

###  ["The Value of Saying No" and Prioritizing Your Focus](https://share.snipd.com/snip/45c1365f-c45c-4545-9178-dc1b11dbd703) 

🎧 04:55 - 05:50 (00:54)

Thomas from Yes Theory emphasizes that saying yes to everything actually means saying no to nothing. Ryan Holiday, in his episode with Yes Theory, stresses the importance of saying no and not feeling obligated to respond to every email. He even relocated to Austin to avoid distractions and focus solely on writing. Saying no is a habit of highly successful individuals.

#### 📚 Transcript

Yeah, it was Thomas from Yes Theory who said, yeah, if you say yes to everything, you're actually not saying yes to anything.

Right. And I think Ryan Holiday, if you go back and listen to that episode that we did with him, he talks a lot about the value of saying no and getting good at saying no. He talks a little bit about too, like you don't have to respond to every email that's in your inbox. You can live by your own, you know, craft what you are focused on. He even took it a step further of moving out of New York because he felt like there was so many things coming out of, Hey, do you want to have coffee? Hey, do you want to do this? Hey, do you want to do that? Where he moved outside of Austin so that it wasn't even an option. All he could do is focus on the craft of writing. So I think like saying no as a default to something I would like to get better at, but like that is the third habit that I thought was like highly successful individuals all do that.

###  [The Athlete Mentality: A Key to Success](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6a079bc5-3470-4cd4-9051-bffac1a830b6) 

🎧 08:11 - 09:27 (01:15)

Successful people have an athlete mentality, treating their bodies, nutrition, and mental health like athletes. Rest and sleep are crucial, as LeBron James emphasizes. Being reckless with self-care is not okay. Treat yourself like a top-level athlete.

#### 📚 Transcript

I would say that's kind of similar to my fifth one, which was athlete mentality. I think I've noticed that every highly successful person we've been around has the mentality of an athlete. The first person to say this to us was Robert Kinsle, who was at the time the chief business officer of YouTube. And what Robert said to us is he said, I'm a work athlete, which means he has to rest like an athlete, treat his body like an athlete, treat his nutrition like an athlete, treat his mental health. Like all this stuff, you have to perform at such a high level that you can't be reckless with how you treat yourself. And I think that's a really interesting thing that all creators should think about. Like, I definitely do not think I treated myself like an athlete in my twenties. I was like, it's totally fine if I work through the night. It's totally fine if I eat pizza, you know, all night before I go to bed. Like, just not fine. Is that think of yourself as like you need to go play like a top level professional sports game

all times. So

pasta at night. Joe, you could carball. Yeah. Why not? Yeah. I mean, don't go crazy with it. But I think, you know, thinking of yourself as an athlete, especially with rest, like rest is something that LeBron James credits so much of like his performance to rest and sleep.

###  [Rest and Sleep: Learning from Athletes' Approach to Performance](https://share.snipd.com/snip/640e9809-1120-44d2-a3a1-cb3c5f64e3ff) 

🎧 09:13 - 10:43 (01:29)

As a creator or creative, it's important to have an athlete mentality. Rest and sleep are crucial, just like LeBron James emphasizes. Top creators have found a workout routine they can commit to and take their diet and sleep seriously. Jerry Seinfeld's commitment to daily writing reminds me of athletic training. If you want to make it as a creator, you must invest in your craft every day, just like an NBA player shooting hoops in the park.

#### 📚 Transcript

Joe, you could carball. Yeah. Why not? Yeah. I mean, don't go crazy with it. But I think, you know, thinking of yourself as an athlete, especially with rest, like rest is something that LeBron James credits so much of like his performance to rest and sleep. And so I think really listening to how athletes treat themselves and realize as a creator or creative,

you have to have that athlete mentality to compete at the highest level. Yeah. The majority of creators who are the top that we've spoken with have figured out the form of working out that they, I don't even know if they enjoy it, whatever, but like that they can commit to all of them have like, whether it's like running or hitting the gym or boxing, they have that figured out. They've started to take diet more seriously. Yeah, sleep more seriously.

Yeah. The last person I wrote down was Jerry Seinfeld, who obviously we haven't met, but or interviewed, but he did an interview with Tim Paris, where he talked about carving out 45 minutes every day to write. And he was like, I can't do anything else, but I don't have to write, but I just can't do anything else. I sit with a pen and pad. And to me, that reminded me of like athletic training, right? Of just like, if you're, if you're going to be a creative, every day you have to invest in the craft of being a creative. And that to me is like training like an athlete. It's like if you're playing the NBA, you're going to go out and shoot. And what Marquez said to us about this was like, if you want to make it as a creator, similar to an NBA player, the guy who's going to make it is the one who has fun shooting hoops in the park every day, because that is how you work on the craft.

###  [How Celebrities Use Marketing and PR to Boost Podcasts](https://share.snipd.com/snip/743e05f8-cc74-4e12-92e8-a83f7342a03c) 

🎧 20:24 - 21:42 (01:18)

A celebrity launches a podcast with other celebrity guests, which is unusual for someone who has never had a podcast before. It's attributed to good marketing and the involvement of sophisticated marketers and PR people. The celebrity attends a high-profile Hollywood party and gets styled and photographed by famous professionals. There are some lessons to be learned from this, including the fact that the world glances instead of reading, and that having celebrity connections can help with attracting attention.

#### 📚 Transcript

Like you, a

celebrity launches a podcast. They have other celebrities on the show because they're a celebrity. Right. Like, there's the network they're a part of. These are their friends. It's unheard of, really, that you would have someone who's never had a podcast before, launch a podcast

with these guests. She went to the variety, young Hollywood party. How does it happen, Samir? I'm telling you, man, it's happened. To me, it's just really good marketing and there's really sophisticated marketers involved and PR people involved because a week after, you know, the podcast run, or maybe four days after the podcast run, she went to the variety, young Hollywood party, was fully styled by a celebrity stylist was photographed by a celebrity photographer. Like, there you just don't learn about all this stuff within a matter of weeks and just have it activated immediately. You just don't. It's just, I don't know. It's just not something that happens. So, okay, I wrote down some notes about what I think a lot of creators can learn about this, or at least what my, my takeaways are. Number one, it's something I say all the time, but I think this is super important. The world glances, it does not read. What I mean by that is we all know the surface level. Bobby Altoff is next to celebrities. She books incredible celebrities. I have never listened to a 60 minute or 90 minute episode of her podcast.

###  [The Importance of Building Relationships as a Creator](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c98df51f-fffe-4955-abae-3815863821d2) 

🎧 23:03 - 25:01 (01:58)

Building relationships is crucial in the creator economy, just as important as revenue. It's unclear how the person in the story has built their network, but it seems to be supporting their rise. Networking has been essential for our show as well. There are gaps in the story that we don't understand. The concept of manufactured scarcity is a smart strategy in any business.

#### 📚 Transcript

I don't know. No shot. That is a moment that they have created. A very calculated moment. So I think, but I think as creators, that's important. When you're about to do something, what's the story of that thing? How are people going to talk about it? Is it remarkable? Is it worth making a remark about? And everything she's doing is worth making a remark about. It's worth talking about. I wrote network is everything. Relationships are one of the biggest parts of your job as a creator. I think that might be one of the most overlooked things in our industry is that to be a successful creator, especially entering this next chapter of the creator economy, relationships are everything. Whatever relationships she has or is building at the moment are really supporting her rise. And sometimes we can think that like work is editing or work is just reserved for working on videos or working on the craft. But part of the craft is building relationships because they can lead to things like this. They can lead to collaborations. They can lead to strategy. They can lead to ideas. They can lead to so much. And I think building your network as a creator is it's almost as important as building revenue. Like network is so important as a creator.

But we don't know historically what her network has been like. No, we don't. We don't know if this has been long-term relationship building or if it's not happened very quickly. Post

Drake. I don't know. But I know that network matters in this context. For us and our show, networking has led us to most of our episodes, if not all, right?

It's taken a long time. I just don't. That's the only gaps, man. The student gaps in the story. The student gaps in the story. I don't get

it. Does anyone know who Bobby Altoff is? Someone tell us because last thing I wrote down was manufactured scarcity.

Manufactured scarcity is a really smart thing to do in any business. In terms of taking the episode down. Yeah.

###  [Tips for Making a Taxi Driver Video More Interesting](https://share.snipd.com/snip/626fe7e1-4a58-41d5-bf81-034a04159c60) 

🎧 30:55 - 32:12 (01:17)

From watching the video, it seems like there is an immediate issue. The viewer is not getting much information other than the fact that the speaker is going on a shift as a taxi driver. The speaker needs to provide something more engaging, like a foreshadowing of an interesting conversation or trying different coffees along the way. Instead of just one video, it would be more interesting to see a series about the speaker's day as a taxi driver in London. Adding different people into the mix can create a consistent yet diverse set. The potential for trivia games or interviews in the taxi cab can make it even more exciting. This is an example of dual narrative storytelling, where the first story is about the speaker's life as a cab driver and the second story is about who they will pick up and where they will go next.

#### 📚 Transcript

So just from watching the beginning of that video, I think there is an immediate issue. What am I getting from this video? Right? Like all I'm getting so far is that I'm going to come with you on the shift and you just got a job to go from somewhere I don't know to the airport. Let's go. Yeah.

I'm going to need something else. I'm going to need something else. Yeah. Like a foreshadowing of an interesting conversation you had. You wouldn't believe what happened.

And along the way, we're going to try every coffee. You know, like something has to keep me going. Unfortunately, like day in the life of a taxi driver is one video. It's not a series. It's not a series. I might be interested in like, what does your day look like? If you drive, you know, cabin London, what does that look like? Interesting for one video. What's

great is you have a set, a consistent set with this added variable of different people coming into it. And as long as those people are interested in being on camera, there are so many great shows that have taken place in cars, even in taxi cabs. Yeah. Right. There's all types of, what's the game show in a

cash cab? Yeah,

exactly. Trivia in the cab or

interviews. Like there's multiple things you could do to make it a little bit more interesting. This is something that we call dual narrative storytelling, where it's like the first story is that I'm tracking is your life as a cab driver, who you're going to pick up next, where are you going to go next? That's a mildly interesting story.

###  [Exercises to Understand Audience Value & Importance of Swag in Events](https://share.snipd.com/snip/dcfe64d7-b04b-4264-8cbe-0c2b553fec65) 

🎧 35:43 - 37:01 (01:17)

Our upcoming course offers exercises that will help you deeply understand the value you provide to an audience. In addition, we discuss the importance of swag and the curation of individuals at events. By getting people talking and providing conversation prompts, we can create value and enjoyable experiences for everyone.

#### 📚 Transcript

I would say all the exercises in our upcoming course would be good for you to do to like deeply understand the value that you are providing to an audience. Was that a plug for our upcoming course? Absolutely. Of course it

was. Okay. The next thing when it comes to an event. Yeah. Swag. Stuff we all get. Yeah. You got to

have some good swag. You think? No,

he don't. But

we gave away swag. We gave away. We

showed up. Yeah. The press publish hat. Yeah. That's cool. It doesn't hurt. Yeah. I'm just saying. No, it doesn't

hurt. Yeah. Yeah.

I think value and purpose number one. Yeah. If we're going to have number two.

Yeah. Yeah. Swag. Sure. Okay. I think actually number one is curation of individuals. Yeah. Like who is in the room and what's the commonality? Number two is value, but also you driving the value. The first creator event we did, which was at three six eight in New York, you and I stood up and called out who was in the room and gave conversation prompts of why you could go up to that person and what you could talk to them about. Most people at a creator event don't know who to talk to or what to talk about and they need prompts. So you have to get people talking and that is at the end of the day. That's what creates value. If I went home and I was like, that was a really great conversation. I had fun.
