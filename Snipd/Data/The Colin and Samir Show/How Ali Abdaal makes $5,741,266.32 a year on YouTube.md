###  [Evaluating the Value of Information and Pricing in a Pure Audience Relationship](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1ce30f1f-61e6-4b69-8ef2-65e7fcc23c23) [[Processed]]

🎧 30:05 - 31:52 (01:47)

Opening yourself up to the cost of monetizing content can be scary, but our audience understands and accepts it. As we consider pricing our valuable curriculum, the challenge lies in finding a balance between its worth and accessibility.

🔒 Private note: Nowadays audience knows that the price they pay for consuming a creator's content is the time they lose watching ads/sponsor segments

#### 📚 Transcript

We need to get to hundreds and thousands of people taking, you know, easy, you know, of course, but then we need to also make sure to service those people. And we see it slightly in e-commerce where like having a merch shop, you know, you have customer service concerns where people are like, Hey, this didn't show up right. And I guess now that I'm talking it out and speaking out loud, we have a team that handles customer service. Yeah. Have

you seen

the people of this? I guess. Yeah. Sometimes you just have to hear yourself say it out loud to figure it out. It is frightening though. Yeah. It's scary to open yourself up to that level of like we have a very pure relationship with our fans and our audience.

Pure and untainted by money. Yes. Okay.

Yes. Meaning like, you know, you get to watch this show at no cost to you outside of the time to watch the ads and the investment in, you know, watching our advertisements, our sponsorships and advertisers. That's the cost of the audience, which I think has become a very understood cost, right? As a consumer, even for me, I'm okay with that cost. So I assume our audience is okay with that cost. Once you introduce thousands of dollars, you know, or hundreds of dollars, I think it becomes, you start to evaluate yourself so much, right? On your value, the value of your information, the value of everything you have to provide. Yeah. And it's where we're kind of getting into this point of like pricing. Yeah. I look at the material we've put together and I'm like, this is everything from the last decade of us learning. Great. It feels really high priced. Fantastic. Then I'll write a price next to it. Okay. Three grand. And then I'll be like, that's ridiculous. That's so high. Mm. And I don't know how to get to a point where it's like, I feel like it's the most valuable curriculum. Like I look at the curriculum, I'm so valuable.

###  [Working for Financial Freedom and Fulfillment](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0c2ae31b-d40f-43c4-a20b-893f167e53cd) 

🎧 52:06 - 53:29 (01:22)

The speaker works for financial freedom and finds joy and fulfillment in their work. They enjoy teaching, but also do brand deals for money. However, they are now shifting their focus to optimizing their lifestyle and pursuing exciting projects. They are unlikely to be idle and are driven by industry validation and recognition.

#### 📚 Transcript

No, no,

really, because. Because I think for me, I haven't been working for the big check. Yeah. I've been working for the goal of financial freedom, which I already have, depending on how you define it. And beyond that, I'm working because it's fun and meaningful and fulfilling. And it's what I would do if I won the lottery anyway, because I enjoy teaching and all that shit. I do the brand deals for the big check and I do live cohorts for the big check, which is why we're now stopping doing both of those things. Interesting.

And so like,

I think it is just about optimizing for that lifestyle business, where if my time is freed up, I may well decide to create another product, but I'll do it because it's exciting. And the thought of making our productivity course feels fun. We're potentially building our own productivity app that feels fun. We're trying to build our own mechanical keyboard, laptop backpacks, that seems fun. It's just like, I'm unlikely to just sort of twiddle my thumbs and play Diablo, if I suddenly had time freed up. I'm more likely to do things that seem exciting. So.

Yeah.

I also want to push back a little bit on the big check. I think there's definitely an element of wanting to be validated financially for the work. But I think a lot of what really drove us was validation from the industry. Yeah. And from peers. Totally. And even you before we started recording saying like, wow, you guys seem like you are the creator show or the creator hub.

###  [The Paradox of Quantifiable Value: Everything we put out has a metric](https://share.snipd.com/snip/36a163e6-dc1a-4986-8db9-816678686764) [[Processed]]

🎧 53:05 - 55:00 (01:54)

The big check was a validation of our work, but industry validation and peer recognition meant more to us. We craved validation and also understood the monetization side of the business. Money wasn't the ultimate validation, but it did provide a sense of relief and a quantifiable measure of value in a crazy industry where everything is measured and associated with money.

#### 📚 Transcript

I also want to push back a little bit on the big check. I think there's definitely an element of wanting to be validated financially for the work. But I think a lot of what really drove us was validation from the industry. Yeah. And from peers. Totally. And even you before we started recording saying like, wow, you guys seem like you are the creator show or the creator hub. Yep. I was like, oh, well, like that's exciting to me. That level of validation is part of what we craved on and wanted. And. Sameer, you are also really good at understanding and navigating the monetization side of this business. Yeah. You

know what I mean? Agreed. I think that comes from like, there's a lot to unpack of why. But I think my relationship with money has been very complex. And so like receiving it was even more complex because I realized it wasn't the thing that was validating.

You know, it may have been necessary in terms of opportunity to take a breath. Yes. For

sure. It was a weight off my back to be like, you know, it's a quantifiable version of value. And we operate in these crazy. In this crazy industry where everything is a quantifiable number that associates a value to you. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Like I was talking to my brother about this. Every piece we put out has a value metric next to it. Right. Then there's a dollar metric next to, you know, how we're performing. There's a subscriber metric. There's so many public metrics that are quantifiable versions of how valuable you are. Yeah. It is a strange experience to have your whole life surround those. But yeah, I think I recognized that like. Like, you know, the outcome of the financial outcome is exciting, but there's a certain cap to like, okay, this is enough.

###  [The YouTube Process: Titles, Thumbnails, and Personal Stories](https://share.snipd.com/snip/dd771781-e1c2-4680-91e4-6bf07c4e4e0f) 

🎧 01:00:22 - 01:01:55 (01:33)

A YouTuber explains their process for creating videos and how they have evolved over time. They now prioritize the title and thumbnail, while incorporating personal stories and conducting research. They used to focus on their own strategies and experiences. The YouTuber also discusses their use of list-style videos, which they find popular and effective.

#### 📚 Transcript

That's a, it's not

necessarily the advice I would give to a complete beginner, because I think once you once you have scale, then you have the luxury of being able to sort of make whatever videos you want to an extent. The way we think about it now is like, Tylen thumbnail comes first, and my team will work on the title and thumbnail because I don't really enjoy that part of it, because that's like marketing and I don't inherently enjoy that. And they'll just give me a title and thumbnail. And all right, I'll eat, you know, this is the video. I mean, like, cool, I'll make it happen. And then I go within and I go to a coffee shop and I think about it, and I'll use some research on the internet and I think what personal stories from my life have got that vibe with this particular title and thumbnail. And I'll turn it into a thing, like a list of talking points. And then I'll film the video. That's our process now. Before it was very different, a lot of like trying to look within and figure out like, okay, making productivity videos. Oh, you know, I'm currently working as a doctor and I'm doing this YouTube thing on the side. So what are the strategies I'm genuinely using and making the videos about that? But the whole like, yeah, how we do YouTube is like a big, big, big thing. Yeah. That's hot to. Yeah.

Here's what we pulled when we looked at some of the formats. We felt like you were following some, you know, formats. The most popular one that you do is a list. Nine productivity or nine passive income. Yeah. 17 things I can't live without. Especially those strange numbers, the nine or the

17. Oh, yeah. So it must be incredibly specific. Of course. Of course. For 17 things.

The

thing is like everything is a list. This is some like, you know, in, I think this is advice from like nonfiction writing. Fundamentally, every nonfiction book is a listicle.

###  [I think](https://share.snipd.com/snip/84ee6d0f-a439-4042-8ad4-b1537af0a686) 

🎧 01:08:02 - 01:09:29 (01:27)

The speaker shares how they don't consider themselves a creative and how they approach creating videos without worrying about technical elements. They talk about their experience as a teacher and how creating videos is a way for them to scale that. They also mention their interest in different formats and discuss the impact of a book on their life.

#### 📚 Transcript

I think

one of the things that I find separates me from the more creative type people is that I don't think of myself as a creative. I don't think of myself as a filmmaker, because my background wasn't teaching. And my background wasn't like, yeah, web designing type stuff. Yeah. And so it was like three years into my YouTube journey before I realized what ISO ISO meant on a camera. Because I was just like ISO auto is like people would be like, oh, you know, you're shooting in a flat picture profile? I'd be like, no. I'd be like, I'd be like, I'd be like, I'd be like,

I'd be like, I'd be like, I'd be like, I'd be like, at Becking Chris's video. How are they so good? It's like they shoot an SLOC 3.

I tried that one time.

Screw that.

And so the way I think is always just like, how do I transmit this information in a sensible fashion? Yeah. Without worrying about like the fact that it's a video or it's a film or it has any creative elements. I don't have the editors to

deal with that. That might come from your experience live teaching, like being in front of students. Yeah. I mean, and being like, it's just a way to scale that, right? It's like I'm just speaking to this lens instead of this group of people. Yeah. Interesting. Man, that was just the first format we observed.

I do think everything is a list, but like I'm curious if you've

watched any other other. I'm curious about this. Like the

next one was the external factor that impacted me. So the book that changed my life. Oh, OK. Fine.

Do

you agree with that as format? Again, it's a listicle, but the title is format. Yeah.

###  [The Two Goals of the Collins and Smirri YouTube Channel](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b4cde948-bdd4-4bfc-8f70-56e70797f3b4) 

🎧 01:17:52 - 01:19:13 (01:21)

Setting goals for their YouTube channel, Collins and Smirri achieved their dream of a creative office in LA and a great team. The journey of constantly pursuing success led them to a moment of reflection on what it means to arrive and meet a new version of themselves.

#### 📚 Transcript

Super inspiring for anyone. I really appreciate that. And I would say that also when we set out on the channel, we had two goals, which is really interesting. The two outcomes we wanted from having the Collins and Smirri YouTube channel was a creative office on the west side of Los Angeles and a creative team that we liked working with every day. Those were the two goals.

You got it. And we've achieved it. Playing the other game. Which is

actually a strange experience. Right. It's a strange experience to like, I find that at any given point in my entrepreneurial journey, I've been either in pursuit of something or constantly been in pursuit of something. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And then when you arrive at something that felt like a ridiculous pursuit, like it wasn't going to happen, it's almost like this reestablishment of like, is the pursuit over? Have I arrived? Is it now time to be present or is it time to develop a new pursuit?

And am I working to maintain? Yeah. Or am I working to grow something new? Nice. Yeah. Yeah.

And I got to speak to a business coach who's kind of like a life coach, great guy, who put it into context for me of like, having arrived at this moment is like meeting a new version of yourself. And that's like meeting a stranger.

###  [The Imposter Syndrome](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c812dcf6-4dd0-4e32-be90-b9368b90bd1e) 

🎧 01:18:49 - 01:19:52 (01:02)

Working to maintain or grow something new? Meeting a new version of yourself. Moving from scarcity to abundance mindset. Developing a relationship with a stranger. Internal identity lags behind external reality by about two years.

#### 📚 Transcript

And am I working to maintain? Yeah. Or am I working to grow something new? Nice. Yeah. Yeah.

And I got to speak to a business coach who's kind of like a life coach, great guy, who put it into context for me of like, having arrived at this moment is like meeting a new version of yourself. And that's like meeting a stranger. So like prior to this, there was like a scarcity mindset of not having things. It didn't have opportunities, revenue, viewership, didn't have the things. Mm. When you arrive to the place where you do have those things, you're now in an abundant mindset or you're living in abundance, right? And you're now meeting a new version of yourself, the abundant version. And that is like developing a relationship with a stranger and will take the same amount of time to meet this new version of yourself.

There's a quote I heard recently, which is, your internal identity lags about two years behind

your external reality. 100%. Yeah, dude. 100%.

###  [Intercompany Sports and the Role of Angus, the General Manager](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5fc234fe-0372-41e6-a6ee-873ffed24483) 

🎧 01:25:43 - 01:27:16 (01:32)

Intercompany sports can be fun, but there's always a divide between the content squad and money squad. Content squad has a great time while money squad deals with stressful deadlines. The general manager, Angus, started as a freelance writer but quickly became an essential part of the business. He's a jack of all trades and now serves as the general manager, handling various tasks.

#### 📚 Transcript

Oh,

intercompany sports. Yeah. You know, one thing I do occasionally here is that like, Oh, it seems like content squad has so much fun. Yeah. Because money squad is the one that's like doing the launches. This is when our launches was quite. And it's like, we've got all these students that paying a lot of money. It's really stressful. And money squad always has deadlines. Whereas they'll hear me say, guys, screw the deadlines. I don't want deadlines. Oh, yeah. Like, oh, you know, I wish we didn't have a call. Yeah. But now we're

going to ever agree. Money squad rules and not have deadlines. So Angus, your general manager, can you talk

to us about that role? What does he do? Okay.

So this is interesting. Angus started off as a freelance like writer because I was thinking, Oh, if someone can convert my videos into blog posts, it's good for SEO or something like that back in like 2020. And then he joined for like one day a week, then two days a week, then four days a week. And then Panamik hit and he lost his other freelance gigs. So then we joked that he moved up to eight days a week as like his role. And he was sort of basically the first, I mean, other than Christian, our editor, he was the first like actual employee of the business. And this sort of became my right hand person, kind of doing literally anything and everything. It's basically his first job, fresh out of university. He also went to Cambridge. And so we happened to be in the same town, which was awesome because we could meet in person. And so the thing that I generally advise people is once you've outsourced your editing, which is like a huge weight off your shoulders, find someone who is like a jack of all trades who can be your right hand person. And then like, I think people make the mistake of trying to hire a specialist, writer as a specialist, that's why the, but actually a generalist is so helpful in the early days. And so now what Angus does is like he's sort of become sort of the general manager of the business over time.

###  [The Role of a General Manager in a Creative Business](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d9167035-12d5-4c3c-bf11-41f4d1062332) 

🎧 01:27:02 - 01:28:22 (01:20)

In business, it's often better to hire a generalist rather than a specialist. The key person of influence should stay above the clouds and let the general manager handle the day-to-day operations. Michael Jordan shouldn't be doing menial tasks; his job is to be himself and lead the team to victory. Similarly, a general manager should support the key person of influence and allow them to thrive.

#### 📚 Transcript

And then like, I think people make the mistake of trying to hire a specialist, writer as a specialist, that's why the, but actually a generalist is so helpful in the early days. And so now what Angus does is like he's sort of become sort of the general manager of the business over time. It's kind of a model that there's a guy called Daniel Priestley, who's become a friend and mentor. He's written a bunch of books about business. His whole model for sort of how a creative business can work is you have a key person of influence who's like usually the YouTuber, i.e. me in the thing in the top seat. And then underneath that person, you have a general manager. And then underneath the general manager, you have the whole team. Now in between the key person of influence and the general manager, there is a cloud and the job of the key person of influence is to stay above the clouds. And the job of the general manager is to stay below the clouds. And any time the key person of influence has to come below the clouds down to the ground to get involved in meddling in the business, you know, you've got a problem. And this is like, you know, the way he describes this is like, you know, Michael Jordan with the Chicago Bulls. Michael Jordan should not be selling tickets. He should not be sweeping the floors. He should not be editing the videos. He should not be doing the social media posts. He should be just

doing whatever the fuck he wants.

And occasionally rocking up and shooting hoops and if he's winning, the whole team is winning, everyone's happy. And the job of Scotty Pippen and the rest of the team is to allow Michael Jordan to be Michael Jordan. And so the bit of grandiose analogy, but I think that's the kind of role of a general manager.

###  [Rapid Growth, Hiring Mistakes, and the Challenges of Building a Team](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3d1fffeb-519d-4bfb-b533-d682dfdd9503) 

🎧 01:32:29 - 01:34:04 (01:35)

During the pandemic, we launched our YouTube Academy and saw a massive increase in revenue. We hired more people to keep up with demand, but it turned out to be a terrible idea. Hiring writers to create more videos in my voice didn't work out as planned. The scripts didn't feel authentic, and I ended up spending hours editing them. Lesson learned: don't bring in new people before the system is created.

#### 📚 Transcript

Yeah. Okay. So basically during the pandemic, everyone had an accelerant on their trajectory. That was when we launched our YouTube Academy, and all of a sudden our revenue skyrocketed. And then we launched the second cohort. And boom, that also did like 600 K revenue. And then we launched the third cohort and that it like 700 800 K revenue or something like that. And so it really felt like, Oh my God, money is growing on trees. We're just we've got this money printing machine the part time you should work out. Okay, cool. We have all these students coming in. We need to hire all these people. It's like, okay, and like, while we hear, let's also do this project and that thing and that thing and that thing and that thing and all those things need people. And so let's hire all these people. And so at one point, we jumped from like, eight people full time to 18 people full time in the space of like a month. And that was a terrible idea. Everyone, I know who runs a business when I tell them that they're like, yeah, that was that's a terrible idea. And I just didn't realize it at the time. In theory, it every higher made perfect sense. In theory, if you know, we want to make more YouTube videos and the bottleneck is the writing, that's just

hire for writers. And then they can

write in my voice because my voice is nothing special. I just read it for teleprompter. And we'll make four times as many videos. In reality, with four writers, we made half as many YouTube videos, because it turns out that in theory, that all works. In practice, it's really hard for someone to write a script in my voice. It doesn't feel authentic. I spent hours and hours and hours editing the script. I don't even record from a script. I record from bullet points. Like, why the hell am I trying to record from a script? It's like, we made the mistake of bringing people in before the system was created.

🎧 01:33:39 - 01:34:24 (00:45)

Writing in my own voice is not easy, even with four writers. It doesn't feel authentic and requires hours of editing. I've learned that it's better to drive revenue first and then hire to meet the demand. Now we have many people in our YouTube accelerator program.

#### 📚 Transcript

In reality, with four writers, we made half as many YouTube videos, because it turns out that in theory, that all works. In practice, it's really hard for someone to write a script in my voice. It doesn't feel authentic. I spent hours and hours and hours editing the script. I don't even record from a script. I record from bullet points. Like, why the hell am I trying to record from a script? It's like, we made the mistake of bringing people in before the system was created. And then like that, the thing that I normally tell people now, which is like the real lesson learned is don't hire in the hope that the hire will will drive revenue. Drive the revenue first, and then make and then do the higher term like service, the demand that you've already created.

###  [The Lesson on Hiring for Revenue Growth](https://share.snipd.com/snip/329a6b6b-a98f-46b2-bc4e-43c63baaf321) [[Processed]]

🎧 01:34:06 - 01:36:29 (02:22)

Don't hire in the hope of driving revenue; drive revenue first and then hire. Adding new hires without revenue can lead to increased complexity and overhead. The ideal team size is around 12 people, as adding a 13th person can disrupt dynamics and require additional management. It's the 'desert territory' between being small and big.

🔒 Private note: Daniel Priestly: 12 is the sweet spot. 12 employees can be managed by a manager. 

12-40 is the problem group.

#### 📚 Transcript

the thing that I normally tell people now, which is like the real lesson learned is don't hire in the hope that the hire will will drive revenue. Drive the revenue first, and then make and then do the higher term like service, the demand that you've already created. For example, now we have loads of people in our part-time YouTube accelerator. That needs lots of customer service. So I have no qualms with hiring more customer success people, because we've already got the revenue. But if I try to hire someone more thinking, oh, that hire is necessary because we want to create a new thing, then that's going to become a problem because what if we don't create the new thing? Now that person's salary is sort of just adding to the overheads. Every new hire is like an exponential increase in the complexity of the business with all of the managerial overhead, communication overhead. And these are all things that I just, again, I knew in theory because I'd been reading them in business books, but only really appreciated them in practice when all of a sudden we had this enormous team of 18 people. And again, to quote Daniel Priestley on this, one thing that he says is that 12 is the sweet spot. As soon as you add a 13th person to the team, suddenly everything breaks, because 12 people can fit around the same table, and 12 people can all basically be managed by the same general manager, just about. Like a general manager can have like 11 direct reports or 10 direct reports. As soon as you get to 13, now all of a sudden you need to split up into different teams. You need managers to manage those teams. And he calls it the desert territory, where you're too big to be small and too small to be big in between 12 people and 40 people. 40 is when you're at the point where you're a big business, you're operating like a big business, you've got the systems, you've got the managers, you've got the leadership team, buddy, buddy, buddy, but if you're trying to be a lifestyle business, that's highly profitable, optimizing for fun, freedom, and flexibility, 12 is the sweet spot. And we just blew past 12 into the desert of 18 people. And I think it's just so true. Like now we have 14. So we kind of moved some people over to freelance contracts and stuff and sort of clawed it back down to 13 and now 14 people. And I'm starting to feel the pain of the desert now, where it's like, oh, we can't just fit around the same table. We are having communication issues now. And so it's like, I think a lot of creators make the mistake of waiting way too long to hire the first person, because the first person you hire is such a big, sort of massive leverage. But then beyond the first person, I'm now like just really, really, really slowly and take probation period seriously.

###  [The Leanest Team for Educational Creators](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1a94e9a3-7f40-4c4e-b09b-45fdb550e642) [[Processed]]

Marquez said creators often grow so big that they forget the craft of making good YouTube videos, which is what truly unlocks success. It's common for creators to think they can juggle multiple projects, but focusing on one thing at a time yields better results. The YouTube channel, paired with one other venture, is the most effective combination. For educational creators, the leanest possible team consists of the YouTube channel and selling a course.

#### 📚 Transcript

For most educational creators that I know, it's the YouTube channel and then sell a course. That's it.

What do you think the leanest possible team is for that model?

I think it's a video editor and a jack-of-all-trades assistant. That's it. Three people. Three people. Yeah.

###  [How Reading Books on Sales and Marketing Could've Revolutionized My Business](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a47631fa-0997-4bac-8b8a-178f046c85f1) [[Processed]]

Instead of focusing on growing an email list, it is recommended to make an offer. The books 'Dotcom Secrets' and '$100 Million Offers' by Alex Womosi have taught the speaker a lot about building offers. By learning from successful people who are making 10 million a year, they can improve their own strategic moves and achieve greater success.

Ignorance debt (talked by Alex hormozi) the cost of not knowing.

#### 📚 Transcript

I'd usually recommend people read.com secrets and $100 million offers by Alex Womosi. Those two books single-handedly have taught me more than anything else about how to build an offer. And actually, I think part of the reason why this latest cohort of our YouTube Academy did so well compared to previous ones. Yes, there was the final cohort urgency, but we completely revamped the offer in the landing page based on literally just reading three books.com secrets, $100 million offers and copywriting secrets.

It was kind of

bizarre for me because I've been selling stuff on the internet for 10 years, and I've never once read a book about how to sell stuff on the internet. And then I read those books and I was like, oh my god, if I'd read these 10 years ago, I would have been a decker millionaire by

now because like, I would have just learned so

much. And this is something Alex Womosi talks about a lot. Like, in the early days of a journey, you're paying off ignorance debt. And the reason I'm not making 10 million a year is because I don't know how to make 10 million a year. And so not knowing how to make 10 million a year is costing me 10 million a year, or like 6 million or whatever the delta is. So I should really spend a lot of time trying to find the people who are making 10 million a year and seeing what are they doing and trying to talk to them and literally fly to wherever they are to hang out with them, because then I'll be like, oh, okay, these people are not working any harder than I am. They have just, they're playing the right chess

moves. Right, they understand how the game works

a little bit differently. And so if I know that those chess moves exist, it means that I can then make those chess moves myself without having to spend all the time and effort trying to figure it out myself. So I don't know, I just think I've learned so much by reading these specific books about sales and marketing over the years.

###  [Learning from books on sales and marketing and the importance of monetization in building a creative business](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7b75ba48-8426-48ad-9ecf-102b0e202625) [[Processed]]

🎧 01:45:39 - 01:46:24 (00:45)

Knowing the chess moves exist allows for making them without spending time and effort to figure them out. Learning from sales and marketing books has been valuable, and creators should focus on monetization early. Building an audience for free then selling is not sustainable. Being reliant on advertising can be challenging. The speaker finds inspiration in the guest's life design and ideas. The guest's story is a pitch to not become a doctor, which raises questions about the future of humanity and the value of being a doctor.

#### 📚 Transcript

I think creators increasingly need to really think about monetization almost from day one, because the old model of building audience for free for years and then sell something, I don't think is a very sustainable way to build a creative

business. I think that's really good advice. I think I think it's a quick path to being reliant on the advertising business. And that I think has proven to be challenging for a lot of creators. So I agree with that. I did want to talk about like you are, even through this podcast, like it's very, whenever I speak to you, it's very inspiring for me to pursue different online businesses, specifically courses, like I find myself very inspired. But I also find myself in the way that you've designed your life to be inspired of like even just listening to frameworks and ideas.

###  [The Pros and Cons of Leaving a Lucrative Medical Career](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9e2de631-6fbc-4357-836f-b2a372cb6fd3) [[Processed]]

🎧 01:46:24 - 01:47:59 (01:34)

Being a doctor was more lucrative, but now some admire and others criticize me for leaving. I believe if my lifestyle convinces people to leave, it's better because we want doctors who truly want to be there. However, if everyone left medicine, that would be a problem.

#### 📚 Transcript

Do you ever think about the concept that you are, your story itself is a pitch to not become a doctor? And like, how does that impact the future of humanity having doctors?

Talking about being a doctor was more lucrative, led to a career that's more lucrative than being

a doctor. Yeah. I

occasionally think about that. I think there is a distinct set of, at least in the UK, it seems about half of the medical students that I know really look up to me and they're like, Oh my God, I love like, you know, it's a dream lifestyle. I'm going to leave medicine. The other half think I'm the worst thing ever because it's like, Oh my God, this guy's terrible. He's like trading off the brand name of being a doctor. And then he's leaving and like encouraging encouraging other people to leave. The way I think about it is like, you know, if me showing a lifestyle that's possible outside of medicine is really the thing that's encouraging people to leave. And those are people we actually don't want in the system anyway. You know, ideally, I would like to be in a healthcare system where the people who are practicing as doctors are the people that actually want to be there, rather than the ones who made a decision at least in the UK at the age of 15 to go down this career path. And I was stuck in there because of all of the life that's built up on top of it. Though occasionally the thought crosses my mind that like, if, you know, I had so much influence that everyone suddenly left medicine, obviously that would be bad. But to be honest, in the UK, it's an oversubscribed degree at university.

###  [The Importance of Longevity and Timeless Work in Building a Brand](https://share.snipd.com/snip/30f11d34-8b31-428a-83c0-74c79f1035bc) [[Processed]]

🎧 01:52:35 - 01:54:12 (01:37)

Longevity and building a premium brand in the thought leadership space can be achieved through scarcity and timeless work. The impulse to constantly create can cause us to forget the lasting impact of a single piece of work. Books, like music and movies, have the potential to live forever and contribute to a creator's longevity. Books have been a key factor in the successful careers of influencers like Tim Ferriss and Ryan Holiday. The idea of waking up, learning, writing, and releasing a book every few years is an exciting and fulfilling life.

#### 📚 Transcript

I think there's one thing you asked me about when we were on the phone yesterday, you were talking about longevity and how do you build like a brand in this space of like thought leadership. Yeah. And I actually think that I thought about that overnight. And I was like, I actually think the two pieces of that equation of longevity and like a premium brand in this space are going to come from scarcity and timeless work. So like you becoming potentially more scarce as you release the book. Less available. Yeah. And the second is a book can be timeless. The book I read from Seth Godin that really pushed me on YouTube was Unleashing the Idea Virus, which was written in the 90s. I read it in the 2000s and I would still prescribe it to anyone who wants to start an online business. Yeah. That's a timeless piece of work. Yeah. So the thing that I sometimes think we forget as YouTube creators that impulse to make something next week because, you know, that's what we do. We want to be a part of the conversation. We want to make stuff. We want to be, you know, present and relevant. And I think we forget that when you put a lot of time into one single piece of work, it can live forever. Yeah. And that's like music, that's books, that's movies, right? Those pieces are timeless. Yeah. Yeah. That

was a big part of why I wanted to write the book. I looked at the careers of people like Tim Ferriss and Ryan Holiday and Cal Newport and these sort of people that I looked up to and still look up to. And a lot of their longevity, I think, has been because of books. And it just seems like a cool life. Like, you know, you get to wake up, you get to do some readings, some learning, some writing, and every few years you release a book and it's like,

yeah, I mean, that's super cool.

###  [The Motivation Behind Writing a Book](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7d9190e9-73a4-4772-968d-6b5adb304bcc) [[Processed]]

The author will only receive around $1 per sale of the book, which is being published by Penguin and McMillan. The advance given to the author will need to be paid off before they start earning any money. The book is more of a lead magnet for the author's brand and courses, rather than a significant source of revenue. The author wants to have a lasting impact on readers, similar to the impact Tim Ferris had on them, and believes a book is a better medium for that than a YouTube video. Writing books is something the author is passionate about, even if they were to win the lottery.

#### 📚 Transcript

It's a lead

magnet, partly to courses, partly just to I guess my brand in general. Yeah. Because if I think like what I want to be when I want to grow up, it's less that I want to make courses. Like the only reason I make courses is because they drive revenue. I want to be sort of, I want to have the impact on people that someone like Tim Ferris had on me. Whereas like I read his book when I was like 17 and profoundly changed the trajectory of my life. And so if I could have that kind of impact on someone else, that feels really cool. And I think you'd get that through a book more so than through an individual YouTube video. And so I guess that's kind of why I've written the book. It's all part of this infinite game thing. Yeah. Like even if I won the lottery, I would still continue to write books.

###  [The Importance of Remembering Why You Do What You Do](https://share.snipd.com/snip/49cf7ae8-dca9-46d3-8bf2-b1af3f0b6294) [[Processed]]

🎧 02:02:26 - 02:03:10 (00:43)

In five years, I hope to be married with kids, living somewhere nice, and pursuing my passion for making videos and writing. I want to have a business that supports my desired lifestyle without being tied to a strict upload schedule. Money isn't a specific goal for me as even people with large net worths still feel a sense of scarcity. I accept that money will always be a part of life, but as long as the business is profitable and enjoyable, I'm content. This reminds me of a quote from Derek Sivers' book 'Anything You Want' that asks if money is the true reason for doing what we do.

#### 📚 Transcript

my favorite quote of all time is from the book Anything You Want by Derek Sivers, in which he says something like, never forget why, why are you really doing what you're really doing? Is it making money? Is it profitable? Are you happy? Are your customers happy? Isn't that enough? And it's like, I'm getting surprised and emotional just like talking about that because there's just so many journeys in this entrepreneur, creator thing. A lot of it is tied up with money. A lot of it is tied up with growth and self-worth being attached to numbers and metrics and stuff.

But at the end of the day,

if we're profitable and having fun and our customers are happy, then that should be enough. I just try and remind myself of that whenever I feel like too much on the hamster wheel of like, I need another video to come

out.
