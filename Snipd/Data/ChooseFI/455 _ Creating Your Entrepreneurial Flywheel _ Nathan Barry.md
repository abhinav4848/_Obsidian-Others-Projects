###  [Excitement about Short Term Rentals and Learning to Spend Money on Things We Care About](https://share.snipd.com/snip/33137cbd-1fc1-448c-a9eb-09014cc4a1d8) 

🎧 06:38 - 07:46 (01:07)

"I think I was just excited about it, especially in like I got into short term rentals in maybe 2018 or so. And that took money and savings to get into, you know, like my wife and I live on a small farm in Boise, Idaho." That's part of a conversation on spending money and finding a balance between accumulating and splurging. The person mentioned a book called Die with Zero by Bill Perkins, which discusses the currencies of time, money/wealth, and health in life. Fascinating concept!

#### 📚 Transcript

I

think I was just excited about it, especially in like I got into short term rentals in maybe 2018 or so. And that took money and savings to get into, you know, like my wife and I live on a small farm in Boise, Idaho. And so we bought this four and a half acre property. It has our house. It had a little guest house. So I was looking at like, oh, the thing that I most want to spend money on right now is like 10 grand to lightly remodel this little guest house. Right. You know, and so that was like, you know, I had savings and it was like, that's my fun splurge. So I've always had that angle and I've had to learn the other side of it of the, okay, let me not just for every accumulate money. Let me get good at spending money on things I care about as well. Yeah.

That's something I definitely want to dive into because I know the book, have you read the book, Die with Zero by chance by Bill Perkins? I have.

I really like his, and I'm sure you've talked about on the show, but him talking about how sort of three currencies in life of time, money or wealth and health. And how you never have, like most people never have all three at once. And so right. Yeah. Big fan of that framing of how we live our lives. Yeah.

###  [The Importance of Margin in Increasing Income and Decreasing Expenses](https://share.snipd.com/snip/452ac6c6-62ac-450d-a508-c85bcef9a34b) 

🎧 14:45 - 15:46 (01:01)

Increasing income and decreasing expenses are key to having financial margin and pursuing opportunities. When you're on the edge, it's hard to think and make moves to increase income. Without margin, there's no time to pursue career certifications or side hustles. Running revenue and expenses neck and neck limits your ability to see what changes you need to make. Chris Gillibot suggests it's easier to increase revenue than decrease expenses.

#### 📚 Transcript

Well, I think, so we talked

about the two sides of the equation, right? Increasing income and decreasing expenses. If you're right on that razor's edge, it's hard to have margin in a different way, right? Margin as far as how you can think and time in order to come up with the things or make the life moves that might increase income. But I'm constantly stressed because there's no margin. Then I'm not going to have the time to pursue, you know, maybe the technical certification in my career to be able to hop to the next job or start the side hustle or whatever else that then is going to give me financial margin. And so it really, like when people end up, you know, running revenue and expenses, neck and neck, then until you get that space, you just, you can't even have the brain space to see, okay, what should I do? And like that little distance, like, hey, let's just get a little bit of altitude, zoom out and go, oh, these are the things that I'm going to do. Oh, these are the changes that I need to make because someone like Chris Gillibot is saying, hey, it's easier to increase revenue than decrease expenses.

###  [The Power of Unique Messengers in Delivering Content](https://share.snipd.com/snip/578eafac-cf48-4e8d-906f-e52cf5fabc31) 

🎧 29:48 - 31:11 (01:23)

A captivating speaker grabs the audience's attention by reading an entire book, building up suspense. Then, they show a video of Ludacris rapping the same book, illustrating that the same content can be presented in different ways. The speaker's message is that there are no unique messages, just unique messengers, encouraging the audience to find their unique angle.

#### 📚 Transcript

So has a hundred percent attention from the audience. And so what he does is he finishes reading the entire book. And first as a speaker, I love that he reads the entire book because he could have made his point, but he like drags it out. So he's like, build all the suspense. Like, where is he going with this? And then he finishes that and says like, you know, like, oh, thanks for listening. Like some nice thing that you might say to your kid or, you know, like, I once ever moved from like and have a good night.

It would have been awesome if he might drop and walk up to the stage. Yeah.

But then what he does, he plays this video. Uh, I believe it's ludicrous on a LA radio station reading, really wrapping the same book. And it sounds completely different. He's got a beat down. And it's something they're just doing like spur of the moment. And Pat's point is that this is the exact same content, right? You could read the same content to your kids in a bedtime story on stage that 300 entrepreneurs, you know, and that's going to have one feel or like here's ludicrous wrapping the same content. Yeah. Right. And so what he leaves everyone with is there are no unique messages. Like it's all been said before, for a CPA, giving tax advice, like, look, it's all been said before. We've written endless articles about five, we've, you know, all the stuff, right? It's all been said before. So he says, there are no unique messages, only unique messengers. And so finding that angle, what is your unique way?

###  [The Importance of Consistency and Dedication in Building a Business](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b11aa0ac-bcfa-4c7c-812e-0a7d3b0bbf3b) 

🎧 40:02 - 41:12 (01:10)

The speaker explains the importance of consistency and dedication in building a successful business. They share their experience of working on their side hustle for two years before it started generating significant revenue. Despite juggling multiple responsibilities, they made the decision to focus solely on their business and saw positive results.

#### 📚 Transcript

The way that I've heard it first and then I quote back again again is show up every day for two years. Cause so many people try a new side hustle on there. Okay. I tried this, maybe it's a blog, maybe, you know, a YouTube channel or whatever else. I worked super, super hard on it for three weekends in a row or when I felt energy towards it, you know, I got a bunch done. It's like, that's not going to do it. Like all of these things to give you an idea. So convert it right now is a business that makes $36 million a year in revenue. Okay. Two years in. So I worked on it every single day for two years. And at that point it made $2,000 a month in revenue.

Holy cow. For two years of work, two straight years. Right. And you did burn the boats, right? You left your, that was your job at that point.

Um, I was a content creator. Right.

Right. Right. Okay. So you had multiple let's say side hustle.

So I was independent and I'd spent two years both being a content creator, writing books and selling courses and all of that on top of design and then also running convert it. And so that's the thing I made a decision. We talked about burning boats.

I didn't burn the boats, but I like shipped them off. You know, I didn't leave them there.

Cause I basically said, I cannot effectively do these two things at once. And they're both suffering.

###  [How to Use Your Savings to Build a Software Startup](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fa335d56-4f74-4a98-8e1a-4f5c5e0b5977) 

🎧 40:46 - 42:06 (01:19)

After juggling multiple side hustles, I decided to focus on ConvertKit and invested $50,000 of my savings into it. Instead of relying on freelancers, I hired dedicated full-time employees, which made a significant impact on our revenue growth.

#### 📚 Transcript

Right. Right. Okay. So you had multiple let's say side hustle.

So I was independent and I'd spent two years both being a content creator, writing books and selling courses and all of that on top of design and then also running convert it. And so that's the thing I made a decision. We talked about burning boats.

I didn't burn the boats, but I like shipped them off. You know, I didn't leave them there.

Cause I basically said, I cannot effectively do these two things at once. And they're both suffering. And so I'm going to stop doing the thing that makes money, which in this case was running my newsletter, writing books on design. I'm going to go all in on a convert kit and I'm going to use my savings. In this case, I took $50,000 in savings that I'd built up from before. Again, what will the money buy you? And a lot of times in my life, the money buys me the ability to invest the next thing. And so I took that money, put it into convert it. We're at 2000 a month in revenue. Instead of just working with freelancers, I hired full-time employees who were 100% dedicated, quick aside, we got a friend who says, if you're hiring freelancers and you're paying for half of their time, you're getting a quarter of their attention. They'll do the job for you and they'll do it well. But if it's something that you need, like to build a software startup from the ground up, like it needs people all in on it. And so like hiring a full-time employee is saying, this is all that you're doing. That really made the difference. Right.
