## Snips

###  [Transitioning to a Proper CEO Role](https://share.snipd.com/snip/388d565b-d427-48fb-aa36-11fe962a42e1) 

🎧 20:56 - 22:18 (01:22)

Transitioning from a small team to a larger one requires shifting to a proper CEO role, which involves hiring more employees to increase efficiency, understanding the complexity of the business, and being prepared for redundancy and operational challenges. This transition signifies moving towards a more structured and organized approach in leading the company.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Sam Parr:** Yeah. I wrestled with it for a long time. Like maybe that

**Kevin Espiritu:** deal took like six months to close, I would say. And at least for the Turner Group, that's not some massive deal for them. Like that's not a ton of money for them. It was a huge amount for me. The logic ended up being, I was like, do I know what I'm gonna do in the next couple of years? Like, do I understand the complexity of the business I had built? Because that's a really lean team to be at 7.3 with like a commerce business shipping product. Yeah, there's like

**Sam Parr:** a bunch of redundancy issues. Anything north of 5 million, it's like, all right, we've got something here. We've got a seed of something working here. It potentially could be huge. I should actually shift to being a proper CEO. And being a proper CEO is hiring extra employees. if like, you know, like at that point, it's like with the size that you were, everyone was working 110%. And at that point, you kind of like almost purposely become slightly more inefficient because you're like, if I get 70% of effort from 10 people, that's better than 110% effort of five people. And I'll have some redundancy so people can like chill a little bit or someone gets sick or quits. Like there's actually like some proper CEO work you have to do at that stage, I would think.

**Kevin Espiritu:** Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, totally. I mean, and the operational side, like the hiring, et cetera side, like I had no clue because I was on a team of me and four contractors.

###  [Money Doesn't Guarantee Happiness](https://share.snipd.com/snip/726a45d5-105c-4354-a835-d70c748765b8) 

🎧 24:36 - 25:48 (01:12)

Having financial stability eliminates worry about unexpected expenses and provides breathing room, making life less stressful. However, accumulating wealth doesn't necessarily result in significantly increased happiness. Money can alleviate downsides but doesn't guarantee a substantial improvement in overall happiness.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Kevin Espiritu:** I have a girlfriend. Yeah. And then a lot of my family lives in San Diego. What's

**Sam Parr:** it feel like to be, I don't know if you were single at the time or not, but what's it like to be a young guy and you're like, I'm good. I'm good for potentially forever.

**Kevin Espiritu:** Yeah. I mean, it's kind of underwhelming, I guess. I don't know. Was it like that for you? I don't know. For me, I had already made quite a bit of money running up through 2021, just sort of solo. And so it was a huge change, but it wasn't, it wasn't like, you know, 1 million to $200 million net worth or something like that. Like the way I live, I just don't, I just don't need it, I guess. Um, and so all it did was eliminate worry about like, I don't know what if something medical goes wrong or

**Sam Parr:** I

**Kevin Espiritu:** couldn't even figure out if I wanted to buy anything for a while. Like I didn't, I didn't buy fancy to celebrate or whatever. Not

**Sam Parr:** having money is... The period of my life where I didn't have money was more stressful than the period of my life where I did have breathing room. That I completely agree with. I always think it mitigates

**Kevin Espiritu:** all your downsides, but it doesn't... At least I haven't found that it makes you some massively happier person yeah
