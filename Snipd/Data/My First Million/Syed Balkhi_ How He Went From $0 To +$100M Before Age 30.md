###  [The Buy vs Sell Philosophy in Real Estate](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1f5f7665-e82d-47b9-8fef-acc099c43176) 

🎧 31:01 - 31:41 (00:40)

In real estate, they say you make money on the buy, not on the sell. The same concept applies to investments. By finding opportunities with a margin of safety and a plan to improve its value, you can maximize your profit from day one.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Sam Parr:** told me something once that sounded almost like a real estate philosophy. So like in real estate they always say uh some people say you make money on the buy not on the sell meaning like you should buy something knowing that it has both a margin of safety and that you have the plan for what it's gonna how it's gonna be different than what the current owner values it at and i think you had a similar thing i forgot what the example was but it was sort of like uh like let's say for example you're like great i buy this company and they're paying three and a half percent on their payment things but i have a contract with that same payment provider because i have more scale that's at two percent so now i know i have 1.5 off just off the gross from day one because i i have

###  [A conversation about travel and stress levels in managing a billion dollar portfolio](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e4cd8ec5-d72c-4052-b5a2-90151efefb54) 

🎧 40:19 - 41:16 (00:56)

I asked him about how he spends his time and turns out he loves exotic travel. He stacks calls in the last week of the month, but the rest of the time he enjoys reading, playing basketball, and doing other things. It's impressive how he manages a billion dollar portfolio without being stressed out.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Shaan Puri:** uh that's my quote by the way he didn't say that was sean who wrote that oh

**Sam Parr:** really well when i him he was like he said something like you were like i travel i was like what are the you know what do you do with your time like how are you spending your time and you were like oh i love to travel my family we go travel and i was like i thought you meant like you know like i don't know la or you know like we go to see the graham canyon and you were like we're going to egypt and then we're going to like the serengeti and we like, oh, okay. This guy's like doing like exotic travel every month. That's cool. He, you said something like, I don't know if this is exactly right, but my brain heard you basically stack a bunch of calls with your kind of operators in the last week of the month. And like, that's your only time to like stress out or think about like those calls. And then the rest of the month, you're not thinking about those things you're reading, you're playing basketball, you're doing other things. And so A, is that accurate? And B, like I interpreted that as, wow, this guy's managing a billion dollar portfolio and he's not stressed out. That's awesome.

###  [The Journey to becoming more Chill and Disciplined](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f8be411c-2b5a-4d1d-beae-19ec11ce5b2c) 

🎧 41:16 - 42:55 (01:39)

The speaker reflects on their personal growth and how they have learned to delegate effectively. They admit to being a bit of a hard ass in the past, but have since become more disciplined. They discuss the importance of using the entrepreneurial operating system (EOS) for transparency and accountability in businesses. They have observed that some founders who delegate too much end up losing control of their business. By reestablishing accountability and finding the right team members, they believe these issues can be resolved.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Syed Balkhi:** Yes, that is fairly accurate. Now, it didn't start that way. I want to emphasize that. It didn't start that way. I didn't figure this out up until maybe two years ago. Okay. So just to put in perspective, in terms of like me being as chill. What

**Sam Parr:** was like, what were you doing before that?

**Syed Balkhi:** You know, I would have to go in, sometimes clean the business and like, oh, this is not doing right. I would get involved too much. Were you a hard ass? Depending on who you ask. Yeah, sure. According

**Sam Parr:** to me? No. According to everyone I ever worked with? Hell yeah. Like

**Shaan Puri:** you seem like you have a ruthless side to you, even though you're polite and kind, you seem like you could be

**Syed Balkhi:** ruthless. I would say I could be very disciplined. Ruthless might not be the right word. Did that sound so ruthless the way you said that? That was awesome. Yeah. That's a ruthless thing to say. That a fucking thing to say. I loved it. So the trick is, you know, like people say, hire good people, get out of the way. But that sounds easier than it is. So we use EOS in our companies and some of your audience might be familiar with it. Others might not be. It's entrepreneurial operating system. And as transparency and accountability, oftentimes when, you know, I found, I've sometimes bought businesses from the founders who started delegating, but they really abdicated and then the business went down. And then, you know, now they're like, they're really checked out. So now they're like, ah, this thing sucks. Now I'm back in the business and it's a mess. And they will come and exit to us. That's a mismanaged gem, by the way, because all you got to do is put back those accountability things and maybe put a right team member. And

🎧 43:58 - 45:14 (01:15)

Starting from scratch, I would focus on building cash flow again. Content agencies, powered by AI and human review, would be my go-to. Tools like clay.com would automate sales outreach, making it more efficient. Hustling with these strategies would be my game plan.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Sam Parr:** So if

**Syed Balkhi:** I had nothing, you know, of course it's a lot easier for me now. I can say, hey, Andrew, want to invest in Tiny. I want to go do this. And I can do a lot of those with the means that I have now. But if I was starting all over, the first thing would be to go build cash flow again. And the easiest way to build cash flow is services, agency business. Right now, content agency, since I know content well, using AI, I would crush it. You know, because I already know that brands like Shopify, et cetera, are using AI agencies to create top of the funnel content. Of course, there's some human editing involved, but this changes the game. Because if an article used to take maybe four hours to write, now you can do it in 45 minutes, right? Because if you know the game right. So a hustler, younger version of me, that's what I'd be doing. Content agencies, copywriting agencies, all AI powered plus human review. I would use tools like clay.com. I'm not sure if you've seen clay.com, but it helps you automate your sales outreach. You dump a profile and it finds all the data on that person. You can write, you can use GPT to write emails to them and then just hit them up,

###  [The Distinction Between Building and Buying: Insights from a Builder-turned-Acquirer](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7e6d875a-cd9a-4102-92f4-8623e919a9dc) 

🎧 45:50 - 47:11 (01:20)

The CEO, who started as a builder and has now acquired numerous companies, reveals his inspiration from Mark Leonard at Constellation. Leonard's insight about growth through organic means, acquisitions, and initiatives resonated with the CEO. He emphasized that initiatives, such as building new products, can be expensive and time-consuming, diverting resources and distracting senior staff. As a capital allocator, the CEO understands that the return on invested capital may not always be favorable for building.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Sam Parr:** there? And talk about that distinction, because you started off as a builder. You've now bought like, I don't know, 30 companies or something like that along the way. And I think you studied not just Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett, but also Mark Leonard at Constellation. And you had told me something like you read all his annual letters and there was one thing in there that really stood out to you about building versus buying. What was that? Yeah,

**Syed Balkhi:** it was one of his earlier letters, maybe like a third one or fourth one or something like that, where Mark talked about that there was three types of growth that Constellation was experiencing. One was growth through organic, which is just your business growing organically, in their case, maybe seven, eight percent, whatever. The second part of revenue growth was coming from acquisitions, where they would just go buy revenue. And the third one was initiatives. And initiatives would be things like new bills. I have this product, now I'm going to build a second product. And he was like, these turned out to be very expensive because it required more resources than time that you plan for. It takes away time of your senior people. And you're not even counting those things. So they're distracted. And he's like, you know, I'm a capital allocator. And from a pure capital allocation perspective, the return on invested capital isn't always great because bills have

###  [The Beauty of Finding a Simpler Path to Success](https://share.snipd.com/snip/533abbdc-9cc8-457b-bc93-84e333e18ed4) 

🎧 48:41 - 49:57 (01:15)

Finding a simpler way to win can be appealing, but it may also be fearful. Building something new has a high chance of failure and takes a long time. Buying something already working may seem less risky, but there's a difference between putting out cash and putting out risk. The speaker wonders how to bridge that gap. Initially, they enjoyed being an artist and leaving their mark on their creations. However, when building the business, they were focused and not indulging in luxuries like a trip to the Serengeti. They were very determined.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Sam Parr:** also have a path of least resistance itch to me where I'm like, oh, there's some beauty in just finding a simpler, a simpler way to win. Um, you know,

**Shaan Puri:** like, I agree with that. I also think it's fearful or it's, it's fear to, to outlay, to pay, like with the internet, you could start with nothing and spend time and you can get something.

**Sam Parr:** But I think that's his point. He's like, you could build something new. High chance is just not going to work. It's a zero. It's also going to take a long time. If you're buying something that's already working, yes, you outlay cash, but are you actually taking more risk? There's a difference between putting out cash and putting out risk. And I think what he's saying is that.

**Syed Balkhi:** the difference between putting out cap? Like, how do you make that gap small? So I'll say this. when I started, Sam, I was very much an artist like you. I enjoyed my creation. I enjoyed putting my, you know, fingerprint, footprint, whatever you want to call it on those. So when, if you were looking at the early days

**Shaan Puri:** of Optin Monster or those products, you would have my footprint on them. And you had like a $20,000 bill to the Serengeti with your family of five. No, I

**Syed Balkhi:** was not doing Serengeti when I was building the business. I'm not doing Serengeti when I was building the business. I was very, very much involved. But

###  [Buying Small Businesses and Valuations: The Advantage of All Cash Upfront](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8dffb09e-6ab0-4040-bff3-d10f8669496f) 

🎧 51:04 - 52:26 (01:22)

Buying small deals with single digit millions in cash upfront, making the process seamless for sellers and offering attractive valuations. Selling to private equity or VC can be a lengthy and frustrating process. Send a message through the website for a quick and efficient response.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Syed Balkhi:** What check made me sweat? None of them because I'm not buying, like I'm not putting 80% of my net worth or my cash in any, any one of those deals. But have you bought things for tens of millions? No, no. I have not bought anything in the tens of million dollar range. But

**Shaan Puri:** these are single digit millions and then do you million single digit. That fucking insane that you built that much value with like these little small like what's that whatever sean said the cigarette butts like you've made the cigar with it but um and are you doing all cash up front or i there's no way you do that you're you're you're way too sophisticated mostly

**Syed Balkhi:** mostly all cash up front you do that. There might be some pieces of like seller financing, but of the advantages that we have compared to somebody offering like a higher valuation is that we can make the process really seamless for the seller. That also allows us to get a better and a more attractive valuation. But if you try to ever sell to like a equity or a VC, mostly private equity, you'll be on the hook for like six months. They'll be dragging you, asking you for all sorts of nonsensical stuff. And by the time the entrepreneur is just burnt out, and it's just a shitty feeling. With us, you send me a message over the website, my assistant sourced through it. I'll look at it and say, okay, yeah, this is good.

###  [The Importance of Managing Debt and Building Wealth Slowly](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c7ee770c-8845-48e2-8e1d-64656f714814) 

🎧 52:49 - 54:12 (01:23)

Debt is generally seen as bad and taboo, though leverage can be useful if used wisely. Financially savvy billionaires may disagree. The speaker is okay with getting rich slowly, comparing themselves to a turtle in a rabbit race. They mention a story about Warren Buffett and his third business partner, Rick, who was just as smart but not as wealthy.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Sam Parr:** much debt do you have? You're like, no debt. And you're buying with a margin of safety. Even with his mortgages. He says no mortgages. No mortgages. And look, there's going

**Syed Balkhi:** to be a lot of financially savvy listeners here. And I have many, many financially savvy friends who are billionaires and they disagree with me on this, you know, but the way I was raised and in Pakistani culture, that is considered bad. It's considered taboo. And sure, leverage can help you grow faster, especially when used in a smart way, but it also takes away the margin of safety, which in troubled times can really destroy your autonomy if you're not being careful. So, you know, I'm okay with getting rich slowly. And I think I've done all right for where I am. I see myself as a turtle in a rabbit race. Bro, you're a 32 year old, like pretty much billionaire, dude. You

**Sam Parr:** didn't go that slow.

**Syed Balkhi:** You know, in 60 years, I think I'll be okay. It helps me sleep better at night, be more bullish. I don't know. Sean, Sam, do you know about Charlie and Warren's third business partner? No, no. Tell the story. See, nobody knows about the third business partner. So they did have a third business partner. His name was Rick, right? Rick Warren or something like this. And it was just as smart as them, but was in a hurry to get rich. And Monish asked Warren about what happened to Rick at one of the lunches that he

###  [Utilizing Government Contracts and Targeted Data for Advantages in Business](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5a8f9c9a-12cb-4c89-a9fe-27b7c5d8c119) 

🎧 57:20 - 58:44 (01:24)

Gain an advantage in bidding by accessing previous construction project contracts. Get creative by obtaining student information from universities and targeting specific groups. Use the information to send affiliate offers for relevant programs. Find arbitrage opportunities to generate significant cash flow.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Syed Balkhi:** a government agency, maybe a university or whatever, hey, I want to see the contracts of your last three or five construction projects that you undertook. And that will give you an advantage in terms of how to approach terms and pricing that was approved before. So when you're submitting your bid, it's better. But you can get really creative like that. I remember I was talking, this was a while ago, I was talking to a guy, he was in the Atlanta area, and he would request student information from universities, so public universities. And he was targeting like nursing school graduates and so on. If you were coming out of nursing school, you know, he wanted your information and schools have to give it to you. And you might pay them like a processing fee of like $100 or something like that. But you get the whole graduating class's name, email address, their physical address that the university have in file. They give that to you. And then he would send those students an affiliate offer for student loan forgiveness program that was passed under the Obama administration, right? And so the affiliate offer was for a company that would fill out those forms for you, right? And they would charge you like, I don't know, 500, 600 bucks, and they would pay this guy. And he was like, I just send one email, I make six figures, and I'm one. So I would find arbitrage opportunities like these to build up more cashflow.

###  [The Pitfalls of Overpaying and Underestimating in Business](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4af45011-b554-4671-8dcb-afeed5ca4eb4) 

🎧 01:06:56 - 01:08:33 (01:36)

Some investors overpay and regret it later due to excitement and time pressure. The speaker, on the other hand, is more patient and disciplined in their deals. They also mention underestimating business problems. The interviewer notices the speaker's growth and maturation over the years.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Syed Balkhi:** One thing that I've noticed, several things, but this is the primary thing, is that the excitement takes them away. So they will overpay on a deal and then regret it later on when they find out. Because oftentimes they have taken investors' money. They are on a timeline. Most of them are trying to raise a fund. Your typical 10-year plus two years, whatever. So they're not disciplined enough to wait. And I have no rush. If I don't buy a company this year, it doesn't make a difference. So it allows me to be more measured and disciplined in the deals that we do. And that's probably the biggest thing. And or

**Shaan Puri:** underestimating the problems that exist in a business. The first interview that I saw with you was, it looks like it was on Mixergy, our friend Andrew Warner. It looks like it might have been 2014, but I think it was even before that. And Andrew was like, how much revenue do you do? And you go, Andrew, I told you, I'm not going to tell you this. And it was pretty funny. And then I asked you to come on here and you're like, I'm not telling you these numbers. You've told us a lot of shit. It seems like you're in a different sphere than you were before where you don't mind talking about some cool stuff. And I think that that's neat because you're maturing from this hacker, probably gray hat hacker from, you know, 20 years ago, 15 years ago to

**Syed Balkhi:** like kind of a tycoon. I
