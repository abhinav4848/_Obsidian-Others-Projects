Let's dive into the intriguing lore of the world through the lens of elven perspective.

Remember, this is not an objective view, but a fascinating perspective from the elves themselves. Join us on this journey of history and writings from an author's point of view.

#### 📚 Transcript

So there's a few things I want to dissect here. And if you are not familiar with the lore of the world and that might be part of why you're tuning into this podcast, then let's go into some of the words here because some of these words are not going to be familiar and some of the phrasing and that's the point of doing the show. So let's dig into it. So first of all, I mentioned earlier, a rue means the one. It also means he alone, the one

who is alone, concepts

like that. Eluvitar, the

father of all, these words come from elven. And we're going to get into that specific elven, which type of elven later. We're not going to go into which type of elven and all of that stuff because that's going to be for later stuff. When we get into the whole, which type of elves and those kinds of things. So don't worry about that yet. Just know that these are elven words that this story, all of the understanding of all of this comes

from the elven perspective. These are

stories by elves about what they understand about the creation of the world. This

is from a perspective. This is not an objective view. This is a perspective from the elves. So always

keep that in mind as we go through any text. This is just something that needs to be understood when you're studying history or writings

or anything like that. And that's definitely something that Tolkien understood is that every piece of writing comes from the perspective of the elven. And that's definitely something that Tolkien understood is that every

piece of writing comes from an author.
