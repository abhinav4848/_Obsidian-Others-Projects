###  [The Initial Prognosis and Perceptions of Life with Type 1 Diabetes](https://share.snipd.com/snip/06a62933-624d-4080-9d6c-3afe9981f437) 

🎧 24:49 - 26:08 (01:19)

When diagnosed with a condition as a young person, the prognosis seemed bleak and it felt like a life sentence. The world felt gray and the future appeared grim. However, there is now a permissiveness for living an active lifestyle with this condition. Although life expectancy may be reduced, it is still possible to live a great life.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Drew Harrisberg:** a role. Right,

**Rich Roll:** we'll get into that. We'll get into that. There's a lot of controversy around that. A lot, lot. I'm looking for some clarity and I know you've thought a lot about that, but let's put a pin in that for the moment and just return to kind of the timeline here, which is you get diagnosed as a young person. I'm interested in what you were told the prognosis is. Now we see all kinds of people being athletic and running marathons, and there's a whole type one, professional cycling team where everybody, it's like, there's a permissiveness or a sort of understanding that you can live an active lifestyle with this condition. Was that communicated to you at the time? Or did you think suddenly your life is over you know it right yeah

**Drew Harrisberg:** i'd say the latter it felt like a life sentence initially i'm sitting in that room and the world caves in it's just i can't explain the feeling of life's over it's i'm done like i have no the future was just so grim like the even it's hard to, but like the color of the world changed, like the saturation was like pulled out of the environment, everything, it was like gray. So they told me that you can still live a great life, but your life expectancy is going to go down. You probably

###  [Food to eat in Paleo-Keto Diet](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7e548d0f-b133-49a4-9661-ebd9eda3f4f6) [[Processed]]

🎧 46:45 - 48:33 (01:47)

The speaker follows a paleo-y keto diet, focusing on whole foods, leafy greens, and non-starchy vegetables. They consume 75% of their calories from fat, mainly through olive oil, coconut oil, fatty meats, and proteins. Although they consume a fair amount of saturated fat, it is a healthier version of the keto diet. The speaker acknowledges that while their diet may sound extreme, it has had a positive impact on managing their diabetic condition.

#### 📚 Transcript

**Rich Roll:** And what exactly were you eating? Like what was the breakdown? What did that look like?

**Drew Harrisberg:** So I mean 75% of the calories were from fat. I definitely did a paleo-y kind of keto diet in terms of I kept a lot of whole foods, a lot of leafy greens, non-starchy vegetables, broccoli, cauliflower. I try to keep it vegetable heavy. I wanted to keep fiber in there. Right,

**Rich Roll:** but like completely non-glycemic vegetables. Right. And when you say 70, I mean, 75% fat. So, what is that? Like you're putting coconut oil in your coffee and... I didn't go to that extent. Saturated fat. How did you consume 75% of your calories and fat? So a

**Drew Harrisberg:** lot of olive oil on salads with half an avocado, a piece of salmon, nuts and seeds on top, and an egg. And then a big base of leafy greens, broccoli, cauliflower, those kinds of things. So salad bowls with lots of fat sources and some protein. I was consuming a lot of coconut oil, fatty meats, chicken, beef. I was eating a fair amount of saturated fat, but I would say I was doing a healthier keto diet than what you do see other people do. Right, that

**Rich Roll:** doesn't sound so bad. I mean, in comparison to videos you'll see online of people just literally taking a bite out of a stick of butter. There's

**Drew Harrisberg:** some,

**Rich Roll:** you know, wild stuff out there, right? But that's still a lot of fat, a lot of saturated fat, but had this amazing impact on your ability to really flatten that curve and manage your diabetic condition. And
