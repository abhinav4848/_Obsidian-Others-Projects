# Effects of the mnemonic medium on reader memory
No links for any of them. Too in depth for casual reading.

The story I’d like to be able to tell:
1. If you complete the review sessions, you’ll remember what you read reliably.
2. … and you would remember much less without those review sessions.
3. … and it won’t cost you that much time.
4. … and this effect generalizes to many domains.

Within [[Quantum Country]], we have strong evidence of 1, moderate evidence of 3, and emerging evidence of 2. We have no evidence of 4 yet.

## Quantum Country user behavior
- [In 2019H1, 29% of QCVC readers who finished the in-text level finished the 1 month level](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zVb7o4mvjVkdW8mtqunmjBh)
- As of 2020Q1, several hundred users have demonstrated 1+ month of retention for QCVC

## Reader perceptions
- “I’ve only done your first quantum country course (so far) but I find it remarkable that I can view the proof and follow it, knowing what everything means. It’s almost like Neo in The Matrix telling Morpheus, ‘I know quantum computing’” [source](https://twitter.com/KeithMansfield/status/1132031824513966080) #external 
- “Doing the review sessions gives me what it promises to do, I guess. It is the confidence that I will remember the material and will be able to juggle the facts effortlessly. Although I already had a little prior experience with quantum computing, I benefited from the essays a lot. It went smooth and solidified my knowledge which was previously quite shaky and had too much white spots before. I’m very grateful for this mnemonic essays experiment existence.” — Dmitry Urbanovich Re: Hello from Quantum Country!
- “Unlike other ways to learn, I am not worried about forgetting what I

learned in the future, because I know there’s someone who will always  
remind me to review the key parts at the right time points. And it’s  
not just a feeling. According to the result of reviewing, I think I do  
have memorized most of them reliably.” — Kevin
