Ranking of [[073- Knowledge]]

If you imagine a graph quadrant:

**Quadrant 1: High Utility & General Knowledge** is knowledge that is widespread through society but is of high utility due to your ability to execute on it. Think about sports, where most people can play the game but only a handful can play at a high level. The two examples Cal Newport uses for these people in his 2012 [book on skills](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-zettelkasten/1999/10) are screenwriters and guitar players.

**Quadrant 2: High Utility & Specialized Knowledge** is the best type of knowledge you can learn. This is the knowledge that is highly sought after in society but not a lot of people can provide. This knowledge is often difficult to acquire (making it rare) because it is hard to understand or takes a long time to acquire.

**Quadrant 3: Low Utility & General Knowledge** is the information that still has utility but isn’t particularly valuable because of its ubiquitousness in society. Over time, more and more information gets slotted into this category due to the ability to search the internet and distributed learning (e.g. MOOCs).

**Quadrant 4: Low Utility & Specialized Knowledge** is the type of knowledge you often see liberal arts majors get mocked for in life. While knowledge about obscure literature still has utility as part of a larger picture, it isn’t highly sought after in society. If you have this type of knowledge, then you have to become much more creative in how you leverage it.
