# Thinking
Thinking is cognitive behavior in which ideas, images, [mental representations](https://dictionary.apa.org/mental-representations), or other hypothetical elements of thought are experienced or manipulated." In this sense, thinking includes imagining, remembering, problem solving, daydreaming, [free association](https://dictionary.apa.org/free-association), concept formation, and many other processes.

Thinking may be said to have two defining characteristics:

- (a) It is covert—that is, it is not directly observable but must be inferred from actions or self-reports
- (b) it is symbolic—that is, it seems to involve operations on mental symbols or representations, the nature of which remains obscure and controversial (see [symbolic process](https://dictionary.apa.org/symbolic-process))."
