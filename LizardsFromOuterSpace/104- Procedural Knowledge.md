# Procedural Knowledge
is the information you’ve internalized ([[073- Knowledge]]) on how to carry out tasks. Often time procedural knowledge will start out in the form a [checklist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6667514-the-checklist-manifesto) before being turned into a habitual model that is invisible and automatic, see [[055- Internal models]].

Over time you develop the ability to execute on the **procedural knowledge** effectively, turning it into a skill ([[103- Skill]]).
