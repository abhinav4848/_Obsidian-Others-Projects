# Sources
**Sources** are the places I go to for feeding information into my Zettelkasten. I have three main sources for information that I feed my zettelkasten:

- **Books** (nonfiction books & textbooks) I have found to be the best sources of new information because not only are the structured nicely but the information is usually of high enough quality because the pain it takes to write and publish a book.
- **Podcasts** offer similar level of content to blogs and are probably the reason I rarely read blogs or related internet content. I listen to a ton of them because it allows me to multi task (e.g. do household chores or drive while listening).
- **Own Thoughts** - walking, which I do every evening with my dog, has been when I usually come up with thoughts I want to put into my zettelkasten. I do this primarily by texting myself

Secondary sources I use:

- Wikis (e.g. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) or [SuperMemo Guru](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_Guru))
- Professional Publications and Journals
- Blogs (rarely use blogs because I find the material to be not as good)
