# Reason for Note Sequences

The reason you want to make note sequences instead of creating just an ever growing wiki entry for each topic is because it lowers the barrier for entry of information and keeps you from wasting time on constant reformulation.

Imagine your notes looks like a Wikipedia page for a topic such as [knowledge](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Knowledge). Every time you come across new information on the topic you have to figure out some way to integrate it into the existing page, which means you’d waste a lot of time on revising pages.

Instead, you can just connect the information to the end of the chain, while keeping it as its own note. This way you can be constantly be adding new information to your [[002- Zettelkasten]] without worrying about how it exactly fits. It lowers the barrier to help encourage you to add new information, especially when you don’t know what information will be relevant when you go to decide to write on a topic.
