# Ray Dalio Archetypes

Ray Dalio has a process for developing external models within the zettelkasten. Instead of calling his maps of reality [044- Model](044-%20Model.md)s, he uses archetypes. Here is a explanation from him: 

“Through my research I saw that there were many cases of the same type of thing happening (e.g., depressions) and that by studying them just like a doctor studies many cases of a particular type of disease, I could gain a deeper understanding of how they work. The way I work is to study as many of the important cases of a particular thing I can find and then to form a picture of a typical one, which I call an archetype. 

The archetype helps me see the cause-effect relationships that drive how these cases typically progress. Then I compare how the specific cases transpire relative to the archetypical one to understand what causes the differences between each case and the archetype. This process helps me refine my understanding of the cause-effect relationships to the point where I can create [086- Decision making](086-%20Decision%20making.md) rules in the form of “if/then” statements—i.e., if X happens, then make Y bet. 

Then I watch actual events transpire relative to that template and what we are expecting. I do these things in a very systematic way with my partners at Bridgewater Associates. If events are on track we continue to bet on what typically comes next, and if events start to deviate we try to understand why and course correct.”
