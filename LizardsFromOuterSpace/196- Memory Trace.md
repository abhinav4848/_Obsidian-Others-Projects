# Memory Trace
is a connected set of neurons that get activated when you invoke a specific retrieval cue. They get strengthened on retrieval, hence why we do rote memorization, and get re-consolidated after we retrieve them.

[APA Definition](https://dictionary.apa.org/memory-trace)

> a hypothetical modification of the nervous system that encodes a representation of information or a learning experience. See engram.

[APA Engram Definition](https://dictionary.apa.org/engram)

> _n._ the hypothetical [memory trace](https://dictionary.apa.org/memory-trace) that is stored in the brain. The nature of the engram, in terms of the exact physiological changes that occur to encode a memory, is as yet unknown. The term was introduced by German biologist Richard Semon (1859–1918) in the early 1900s and was popularized by Karl S. Lashley in his 1950 paper “In Search of the Engram.” Also called mneme; mnemonic trace; neurogram.

> a neural circuit in which nerve impulses that were initially activated in response to stimuli are more or less continuously reactivated so that retrieval of information on demand is possible. A theory of reverberating circuits has been proposed to explain learning and memory processes. Although reverberating circuits have been demonstrated only in the autonomic nervous system, they are also believed to exist in the central nervous system. Also called reverberatory circuit.

Related Term - [APA Cell Assembly Definition](https://dictionary.apa.org/cell-assembly)

> a group of neurons that are repeatedly active at the same time and develop as a single functional unit, which may become active when any of its constituent neurons is stimulated. This enables, for example, a person to form a complete mental image of an object when only a portion is visible or to recall a memory from a partial cue. Cell assembly is influential in biological theories of learning and memory. (proposed in 1949 by Donald O. Hebb)
