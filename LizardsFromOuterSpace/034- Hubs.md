# Hubs
**Hubs** are collections of note sequences centered around a theme. You create a hub once you notice a bunch of notes in your index ([[026- Index]]) centered around a topic.

An example in my own zettelkasten ([[002- Zettelkasten]]) is I had the follow index entries

- Note Taking, Problems in
- Note Functions, Core
- History of Note Taking
- Public Note Repositories
- Ideal Note Taking Program

Once I notice 5-10 notes centering around a certain topic (e.g. Note Taking) I will excise them out the index into their own note and then link that new hub note to the index.
