# Food rules as an example of external model

Food Rules: An Easter’s Manual by Michael Pollan is a small 140 page book on how to eat healthy by a journalist who has been reporting on nutritional science. It is meant to be a “set of straightforward, memorable rules for eating wisely, one per page, accompanied by a concise explanation”.

Regardless of its validity (I know people love to argue about nutrition on the internet), it serves as a nice example of what an externalized model ([055- External Models](055-%20External%20Models.md)) would look like. A [044- Model](044-%20Model.md) (set of rules) is meant to help guide you in decision making (what to eat) around a specific topic (food).

You could imagine a 20 note sequence, where the first note is an idea and the 19 subsequent notes are your running commentary on that idea over a 5 year period. Once that note sequence has reached long enough and you have a good feeling about it, you condense it down into one rule. This one rule than becomes part of a larger model.

Or you condense it down into one model, extracting the most important rules out of the 19 notes (say you are able to formulate 4 rules total).
