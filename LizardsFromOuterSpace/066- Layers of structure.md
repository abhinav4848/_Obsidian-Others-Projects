# Layers of structure

are restrictions you place upon your workflow or tools that add order, which in turn creates repeatability. Repeatability is important for effective note taking because it allows for a greater amount of [041- Applicability](041-%20Applicability.md) per note. This is the same idea behind creating connections ([094- Connections (knowledge)](094-%20Connections%20(knowledge).md)) between notes and keeping notes atomic.

Once you get a sufficient amount of **layers of structure** together then they make up a workflow or system such as [002- Zettelkasten](002-%20Zettelkasten.md) or [066a- PARA structure](066a-%20PARA%20structure.md)
