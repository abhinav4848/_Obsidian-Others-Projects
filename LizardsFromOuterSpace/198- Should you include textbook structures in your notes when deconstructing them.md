## Should you include textbook structures in your notes when deconstructing them ([[131- Textbook Deconstruction]])?

This is a question that I’m still trying to work out in my head. When picking apart a textbook and taking notes on it, what are the components you can take notes on?

- Quotes
- Excerpts
- Your Own Reactions
- Individual Concepts
- Interconnected Concepts
- Models (Set of Rules)
- Summary of Book
- Review of Book
- Summary of each Chapter
- Book’s Table of Contents

This means that your notes on a book could either be very short (say the note just includes bibliography information and links to a few quotes) or very long (include all of the above components).

I’m not entirely sure what is the right balance? If I frame it through the lens of utility, then I’d want to find what level of note taking do I get the most bang for my buck. The very long notes probably have the most utility but tend to be very time consuming to make. The short ones are quick, but you want to avoid having to reread the book down the line.
