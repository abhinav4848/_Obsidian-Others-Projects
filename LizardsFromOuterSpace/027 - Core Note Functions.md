# Core Note Functions
I see the four core note functions of text management as the “[[first principles]]” of note taking, serving as a set of useful lenses to look at the tools and methods of note taking throughout history. They can also be used for thinking about modern note taking. The **four core functions** are: [[053- Storing]], [sorting](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-zettelkasten/1999/96), [selecting](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-zettelkasten/1999/97), and [summarizing](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-zettelkasten/1999/98) [(Blair 2010, pg 15)](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-zettelkasten/1999/10). I’ve also added [compiling](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-zettelkasten/1999/124) to the list.

The core functions emerge from the [main purpose of note taking](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-zettelkasten/1999/30).

You can analyze how the functions individually have evolved over time and also how they manifested throughout the various mediums of knowledge management. [See 5A](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-zettelkasten/1999/28) .
