# Quality of Connections
Every note you create will be full of terminology. Each term is a connection you can create in a note. Then you can also put in connections to related concepts that aren’t directly mentioned in the note, which you’ll see when I put a “See” or “Related” at the end of the note.

This led me to think about what is the right balance with linking? I imagine that heavily linking my notes, such that every sentence has multiple links, is not only distracting but a waste of time. You want to strike a balance, such that you are only linking the most useful information. You can think about it through the utility & surprisal framework ([[117- Information Surprisal and Utility]]). 

**High Quality Connections** would therefore be ones that are useful ([[119- Surprising & Useful Information]]), even if they aren’t surprising ([[121- Unsurprising & Useful]]). A perfect link would be one that would provide you with **new information** that you can use. A less than ideal link (but still good) would be one that provides you with useful information but you pretty much already know. This leads to the question of “what makes a link useful?” ([[172- Useful links]]).

**Low Quality Connections** would be connections that have little utility, whether they be surprising ([[120- Surprising & Useless]]) or not ([[122- Unsurprising & Useless]]). What would be an example of both?
