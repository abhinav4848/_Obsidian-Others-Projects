# Concept
Concept is “a generalization ([[040- Generalization]]) of a set of objects/nouns. It overlaps with idea, entity, notion, group, etc.” [(Wozniak 2020)](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge). **Concepts** allow you to work with new but familiar objects because you can match them to the “prototypical example” and immediately gain information about them.

If all you’ve used in your life are kitchen table and rocking chairs, then you don’t suddenly become unable to sit when presented with a computer chair. You are able to successfully adapt to the new chair because you have the **concept** of a chair to work with.

### Wikipedia Definition

> **Concepts** are defined as [abstract](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Abstraction) [ideas](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Idea) or general notions that occur in the mind, in speech, or in thought. They are understood to be the fundamental building blocks of [thoughts](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Thought) and [beliefs](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Belief). They play an important role in all aspects of [cognition](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cognition).

> In [contemporary philosophy 2](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Contemporary_philosophy), there are at least three prevailing ways to understand what a concept is: [[4]](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Concept#citenoteStanfordEncycl4)
> 
> - Concepts as [mental representations 1](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Mental_representation), where concepts are entities that exist in the mind (mental objects)
> - Concepts as [abilities](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Skill), where concepts are abilities peculiar to cognitive agents (mental states)
> - Concepts as [Fregean](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fregean) senses (see [sense and reference](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sense_and_reference)), where concepts are [abstract objects](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Abstract_objects), as opposed to mental objects and mental states

> Concepts can be organized into a hierarchy, higher levels of which are termed “superordinate” and lower levels termed “subordinate”. Additionally, there is the “basic” or “middle” level at which people will most readily categorize a concept. [[5]](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Concept#citenote5) For example, a basic-level concept would be “chair”, with its superordinate, “furniture”, and its subordinate, “easy chair”.

> When the mind makes a generalization such as the concept of _tree_ , it extracts similarities from numerous examples; the simplification enables [higher-level thinking](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hierarchy_(thinking)).
> 
> A concept is [instantiated (reified)](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/instantiate#Verb) by all of its actual or potential instances, whether these are things in the real world or other [ideas](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Idea).
