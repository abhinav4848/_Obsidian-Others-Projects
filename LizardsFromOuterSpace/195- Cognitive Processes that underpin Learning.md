At the ground level of learning is the process of **knowing** (remembering), whereby you create the memory trace and pair it with a retrieval cue ([[197- Retrieval Cues]]) so that you can pull up the information when presented with the retrieval cue at a later date.

**Understanding** ([[186- Understanding]]) is when you connect the information (memory traces [[196- Memory Trace]]) with your wider body of knowledge, whereby it gains meaning from becoming useful. An example of knowing information without understanding would be memorizing the words of a foreign language without connecting it to the equivalent words in your native language. So if someone were to say the words to you, you’d be able to say them back, but would not be able to act on them because there is no understanding. When the words have no utility then they are meaningless. Further Reading: [[192- Understanding vs. Knowing]].

The goal is to achieve a full **understanding** of a subject, such that you can make predictions around the subject and successfully apply the knowledge to situations in life (e.g. decision making ([[086- Decision making]] & [skills](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-zettelkasten/1999/104)).

The purpose of knowledge in the world is for use, the utility of information is what makes it meaningful ([[193- Meaning]]) in my opinion. The mind isn’t built to randomly memorize information, instead its built for remembering information that gets a lot of utility and is meaningful. That is why it is important to acquire the memory traces on how to **apply** the information you learn.

Part of structure building process in learning involves **analyzing** a topic to understand how its organized and its various sub concepts. This is necessary step to create meaning out of information. Often times in school, this step is explicitly done for you on paper within textbooks. It is still a good skill to develop for when you leave school and have to learn on your own (I do a lot of that).
