# Layers of Structure in a Digital Zettelkasten

When you build a zettelkasten you are adding [066- Layers of structure](066-%20Layers%20of%20structure.md) to facilitate note retireval ([007- Structuring for Retrieval](007-%20Structuring%20for%20Retrieval.md)).

1. The **first layer** of structure is having a single storage mechanism. In this case it is plain text files using markdown syntax. The reason for this is it helps makes your notes future proof. Luhmann used his zettelkastens over a 46 year period, so you want something that lasts the test of time.
2. The **second layer** of structure for a digital zettelkasten is having a single storage location.
3. **Third layer** of structure I use is having my notes in Google Drive. Reason for this is that it keeps a copy of my zettelkasten in multiple locations in case of disaster.
4. **Fourth layer** of structure is having a unique identifier for each note, which means giving each file a unique name. This can take the form of a unique filename, a time ID + filename, or a Luhmann ID. For my Obsidian zettelkasten, I use a combination of time IDs and time IDs + filename.
5. **Fifth layer** of structure is I try to keep to keep my note sizes between 1-3 paragraphs. This keeps you from getting confused when linking between notes and makes a note easy to comprehend. Ideally this would also mean you learn to be concise with your writing.
