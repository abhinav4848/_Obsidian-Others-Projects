# Knowledge work

Knowledge Work is the creation, manipulation, and expression of [[073- Knowledge]]. Usually it is done with the aim of a solving a problem using cognitive skills. The creation of knowledge can take the form of the remixing ideas (<https://www.everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series>) (e.g. new music, lateral thinking with withered technology [Wikipedia](068-%20Knowledge%20work.md)), cutting edge research, and new perspectives. Expression of knowledge can be a teacher explaining concepts to students, a presentation at work, or a doctor giving you a diagnosis.

Knowledge Work is important because it is becoming an ever valuable form of work, especially if you can excel at it. In Cal Newport’s [book on skills](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13525945-so-good-they-can-t-ignore-you) he puts forth the idea that you can become very successful by learning how to improve in knowledge work because so many suck at doing so. The reason being because the path to improvement isn’t as clearly defined as it is with areas such as sports or more traditional work.
