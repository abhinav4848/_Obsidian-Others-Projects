# **Problem of Categorization**

The problem of categorization is a confusing one to me because I feel like you are going to run into the same problem no matter what. The zettelkasten supposedly gets around this by having you start an arbitrary branch or brand new number at the end when you can’t find a place to put your new note. Where I get confused is that this just seems like the same process as starting a new category if your new note doesn’t fall into the existing categories?

The true problem in my mind is that of a failure in the retrieval process, such that you end up creating essentially near duplicate tags or categories.
