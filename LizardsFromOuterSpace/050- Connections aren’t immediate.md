# Connections aren’t immediate

New knowledge often comes from the interaction between your existing knowledge base and what you learn. You will not always have an aha moment during a research project but you perhaps may have it 2 years later when a new piece of information allows you to see a connection ([094- Connections (knowledge)](094-%20Connections%20(knowledge).md)) that you hadn’t before. This is one of the reasons for why the [[002- Zettelkasten]] works so well.

It gives you [066- Layers of structure](066-%20Layers%20of%20structure.md) that allow for information to be connected, that are separated by stretches of time.
