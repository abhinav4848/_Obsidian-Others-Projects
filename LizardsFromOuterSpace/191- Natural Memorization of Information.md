# Natural Memorization of Information
is the process of creating memories through repeat exposure to information in your environment. This is our default way of learning, as it happens everyday throughout your entire life.

A simple example of this is how you learn your coworkers name through repeat engagement with them. This will happen automatically over time, without the need to deliberately remember their name.

This is in contrast to the deliberate memorization of information ([[189- Deliberate memorization of information]]) we do in our education system.
