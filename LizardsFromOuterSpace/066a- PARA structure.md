A Universal System for Organizing Digital Information.

1. A **project** is “a series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline.”
    - Eg:
        1. Complete app mockup;
        2. Develop project plan;
        3. Execute business development campaign;
        4. Write blog post;
        5. Finalize product specifications;
        6. Attend conference
2. An **area of responsibility** is “a sphere of activity with a standard to be maintained over time.”
    - Eg:
        1. Health;
        2. Finances,
        3. Professional Development;
        4. Travel;
        5. Hobbies;
        6. Friends;
        7. Apartment;
        8. Car;
        9. Productivity;
        10. Direct reports;
        11. Product Development;
        12. Writing
3. A **resource** is “a topic or theme of ongoing interest.”
    - Eg:
        1. habit formation;
        2. project management;
        3. transhumanism;
        4. coffee;
        5. music;
        6. gardening;
        7. online marketing;
        8. SEO;
        9. interior design; architecture;
        10. note-taking
4. **Archives** “inactive items from the other three categories.”
    - Eg:
        1. projects that have been completed or become inactive;
        2. areas that you are no longer committed to maintaining;
        3. resources that you are no longer interested in

Projects always fall into Areas. A few examples:

- Running a marathon is a project, whereas Health is an area
- Publishing a book is a project, whereas Writing is an area
- Saving 3 months’ worth of expenses is a project, whereas Finances is an area
- A vacation to Thailand is a project, whereas Travel is an area
- Planning an anniversary dinner is a project, whereas Spouse is an area

In all these examples, the projects have completion dates. They are either complete or incomplete. The areas of responsibility, on the other hand, have standards of performance that must be maintained indefinitely.
