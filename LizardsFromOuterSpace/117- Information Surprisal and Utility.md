# Information Surprisal and Utility
You want information you communicate to be useful and surprising.

I can spout at you crazy conspiracy theories, which are entertaining due to their level of suprisal but only go so far because of their limited use. You want information that can be useful to you by aiding in the creation of new knowledge ([[074- Creation of Knowledge]]) or supporting the execution of a skill.

**You also want information you are communicating to be surprising**. People would get really annoyed if you walk up to them and say their name to them over and over again. It has a surprisal factor when you say their name for the very first time because it gets their attention. The fact that you want to “communicate with them”, which is what you are signaling when you say their name, will be surprising to them. Unless you signal to them in some other way, which removes the surprisal, such as walking up to them.
