**132 - Foundational Notes** are the notes you make to create an initial layer of structure that further notes will be tied to. **They are created to help facilitate [knowledge development](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-zettelkasten/1999/115)**.

They can take the form of basic knowledge (e.g. term’s definition) or structural knowledge (e.g. book’s table of contents). Sometimes those are combined, as is the case with my [future roles note](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-zettelkasten/1999/72), which lays out all the different future roles and provides defenitions for each.

When thinking about basic knowledge, it can be well established and already defined information (e.g. cognition note [[078- Cognition]]) or new terminology (e.g. [evergreen notes 6](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C)).

Notes on structural knowledge are for mapping out an idea, in which you think you’ll forget the map. I will often do this with the use of bullet point lists at the end of notes. An example of this would be [Note 111](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-zettelkasten/1999/112), pictured below.

I will often put a #todo at the end of it as a reminder to come back and create notes around the different parts of the map/outline.
