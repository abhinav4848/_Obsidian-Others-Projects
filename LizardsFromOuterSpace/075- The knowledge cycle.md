The dark circles represent the new knowledge you come across through reading a broad selection of books (or exposing yourself to a broad set of information). You then let it interacts with your [prior knowledge](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-zettelkasten/1999/77) (red arrow of expertise, 18c) to help you come up with new ideas and solve novel problems. See lateral thinking #todo

The transparency of the circles reflects the idea that you dive into various ideas at different levels. Sometimes you may go deep in learning a concept, other times you’ll stick to just getting a surface level understanding.
