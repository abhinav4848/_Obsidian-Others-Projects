# Small World Network
Small World Network is a type of mathematical graph in which most nodes are not neighbors of one another, but the neighbors of any given node are likely to be neighbors of each other and most nodes can be reached from every other node by a **small** number of hops or steps (Source: [Wikipedia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Small-world_network)).

This is how the brain is connected, with good near and far connections, with every cell being more closely linked than a random or lattice network.
