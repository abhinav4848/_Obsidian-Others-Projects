# Specialized Knowledge
Specialized Knowledge is the extensive body of knowledge ([[073- Knowledge]]) you have about a subject matter. It would be pathway A in prior knowledge ([[076- Prior Knowledge]]). Typically this is acquired over many years of study. The acquisition of specialized knowledge follows this path:

**Quick Overview**: give you a very basic understanding of a subject matter, a good source for these would be the [Oxford Very Short Introduction Series](https://global.oup.com/academic/content/series/v/very-short-introductions-vsi/?cc=us&lang=en&)

**Basic Understanding**: Introductory College Course that lays out the current structure of the field, its major models and terminology. You can often acquire this on your own either through [MOOCS](https://www.classcentral.com/) or [commonly used books 2](https://opensyllabus.org/).

**Intermediate Understanding**: Getting an undergraduate degree of a subject matter, where you dive into the various sub-disciplines and get a better understanding. Follow the same strategy as above, but for the sub-disciplines. A good resource is [Kio Stark’s book](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Go-Back-School-Handbook/dp/0988949008).

**Advanced Understanding**: Is where you get a graduate degree in a subject matter and become an expert. You form an advanced mental model of a subject matter and start to poke around the edges, either reforming the existing models or answering unknown questions regarding the existing ones.
