# Prior Knowledge
Prior knowledge is the information you have personally turned into [[073- Knowledge]] through a lifetime of learning. It is the knowledge you use for creative problem solving with the knowledge cycle ([[075- The knowledge cycle]]). There are two paths of acquisition for **prior knowledge**, represented below by A and B.
![[Specialized vs General Knowledge.png]]This web represents the body of knowledge out there.

**The first pathway A** involves specializing, working your way towards the edge of the current body of knowledge before working on expanding it (research, theorizing, etc.).

**The second pathway B** is the process of starting from the basics in every area of knowledge and slowly expanding your knowledge base. This is essentially what a generalist would do. This is what [Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/2013/08/choose-your-next-book/) calls “most useful knowledge is a broad-based multidisciplinary education of the basics”. It is the approach you take until you get to college and start to specialize.
