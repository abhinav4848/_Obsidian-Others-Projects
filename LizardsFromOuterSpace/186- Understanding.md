## Understanding
more broadly is the process of acquiring knowledge about a topic such that you can make predictions about it.

On a **neurological level** this means creating a network of memory traces (chains of neurons) ([[196- Memory Trace]]) such that you can pull to mind all the relevant information on an idea through [spreading activation](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spreading_activation). This is done through the natural ([[191- Natural Memorization of Information]]) or [deliberate memorization](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-zettelkasten/1999/191) of connections in everyday [learning](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-zettelkasten/1999/192). These connections can take the form of knowing the relationship between two concepts or how the new information relates to prior knowledge. You essentially want to create as many retrieval cues ([[197- Retrieval Cues]]) as possible, so that you can pull up the information when needed.

**Conceptually** understanding means forming a working model around an idea whereby you can predict the output with a given input. On the most basic level, you can think of a simple math equation. You develop an understanding of it such that If I give you a set of inputs you can tell me what the output will be. This means knowing all the different components of the model (e.g. rules & concepts) and how they relate to each other.

**With a zettelkasten** understanding means taking the above working model and making it explicit through a series of connected notes instead of just having it all within your head in the form of a mental model.

The concept of understanding can be applied to the four different types of knowledge outlined in [Bloom’s Taxonomy Revised 2](https://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching/effective-teaching-practices/revised-blooms-taxonomy/):

1. **Understand Factual Knowledge** - construct meaning out of the basic information on a subject matter. **What is meant by “construct meaning”?** #todo
2. Understand Conceptual Knowledge
3. Understand Procedural Knowledge
4. Understand Metacognitive Knowledge

Conceptual - The interrelationships among the basic elements within a larger structure that enable them to function together.

Procedural - How to do something, methods of inquiry, and criteria for using skills, algorithms, techniques, and methods.

Metacognitive - Knowledge of cognition in general as well as awareness and knowledge of one’s own cognition

Understand - Construct meaning from instructional messages, including oral, written and graphic communication.
