## Mediums of Information Management
are the different ways we record information or knowledge.

- [Biological Information](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/information-biological/) is stored and used through DNA, one of the basic forms of order. See [Demon in the Machine](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/37860033-the-demon-in-the-machine).
- Memory ([[029- Core Note Functions in Memory]])- information is stored through the use of small-world networks of neurons in our brains. It is believed that our brain has 100 trillion connections between 86 billion neurons ([DK Publishing Brain 2020, pg 27](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-zettelkasten/1999/10)).
- [External Memory](https://www.amazon.com/Memory-Code-Secrets-Stonehenge-Monuments/dp/1681773252) - idea of using external monuments and tools as [retrieval cues](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-zettelkasten/1999/199) for a memory place in prehistoric society.
- **Leveraging Spatial Memory** is the concept of using our enhanced [visuospatial function](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Visuospatial_function) to tie information to well known places we have already well memorized in our brain. See [Method of Loci](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Method_of_loci).

With the emergence of writing, we can now **store and share** information on mediums that require minimal use of the brain (only for interpretation). Further reading - see _[Alpha Beta: How 26 Letters Shaped the Western World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95878.Alpha_Beta)_

- Tablets are flat, square or rectangular blocks of material used for inscriptions. Material used to make the tablets tends to be clay, stone, and wood.
    - [Clay Tablets](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Clay_tablet) were used in the ancient near east, primarily during the bronze and iron age.
    - [Bloomberg Tablets](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bloomberg_tablets)
    - [Vindolanda Tablets](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Vindolanda_tablets)
- Scrolls
- Reference Books
- Note Boxes (e.g. [[002- Zettelkasten]])

The introduction of the computer has led to an explosion of information sharing and management. Now there are many different ways one can store their notes (important information) digitally.

- Wiki
- Note Programs (Obsidian)

Future of Information Storage returns to the roots of reality with the manipulation of DNA and quantum computing for storing information.

- [Qubit](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Qubit) is the basic unit of quantum information, with the two states of an electron spin.
- [Digital DNA](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/DNA_digital_data_storage)

A lot of the programs are geared towards information storage and retrieval, basic functions of management. The next step that is being taken and is important to keep in mind for designing note software is tools for **knowledge development**. How can we help people

- Connect Knowledge in meaningful ways?
    - Contextual Information that is [[121- Unsurprising & Useful]]
    - Structural Connections that illustrate the connections in a model
- Help facilitate the building of external models through note taking
- Store Knowledge such that you can find all the relevant information when searching?
- Make notes shareable through

#### Unconventional Storage

- One form of unconventional storage is showcased in the movie [Memento](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Memento_(film)), directed by Christopher Nolan. The main character has important information written on his body as a way to overcome [anterograde amnesia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Anterograde_amnesia).
