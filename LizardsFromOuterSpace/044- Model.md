# Model

Model is a “set of [045- Rule](045-%20Rule.md)s that apply to a specific phenomenon. It overlaps with theory, metaphor, opinion, schema, view, (concept) map, and more” (Wozniak 2020).

When we take information through the process of [040- Generalization](040-%20Generalization.md) and use [052- Structure building framework](052-%20Structure%20building%20framework.md)), we create a mental model of the phenomenon. This process distills the most important parts of the model, which we can then use to carry out a task (e.g. drive a car to work) or solve a problem (e.g. got a flat tire on a car) in the future.
