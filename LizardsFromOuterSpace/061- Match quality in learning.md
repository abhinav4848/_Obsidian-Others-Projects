# Match Quality in Learning 
**Match Quality in Learning** is the idea that you want new information being processed by someone to connect with their [prior knowledge](https://tll.mit.edu/guidelines/prior-knowledge) such that they are able to understand the new information being taught.

A very easy way to understand this concept is to think about reading. You don’t hand a student a history textbook before they are able to read. They need to have the prior knowledge of letters and words to understand the textbook.

If the match quality is bad then the student becomes confused and frustrated. On the other hand the match quality can be bad because it isn’t new information. For example, say your name is Bob Loblaw. If I repeat the words “your name is Bob Loblaw” over and over again then I am wasting your time because you already know this.
