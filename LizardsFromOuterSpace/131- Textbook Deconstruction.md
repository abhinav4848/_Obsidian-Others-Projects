## Textbook Deconstruction

start out by **asking yourself why** you are reading the textbook? This will dictate what the best approach to taking notes on it will be.

1. Required for your primary field of study? (e.g. Introduction to Psychology textbook for student planning on becoming a Psychologist, see specialized knowledge)
2. Part of your learning for general knowledge? (e.g. Economics Textbook for a course that you have to take but isn’t part of your core knowledge base)

Components of a textbook you can take notes on: key terms, concepts, models, and their relationships. For introductory textbooks, you can often think of the table of contents as a representation of a basic model of the field. What can you do with these components?

- Use as foundational notes ([[132- Foundational Notes]]) for further development
- Use as foundational notes & memorize them
- Use as notes for future reference
- Do not take notes but instead strictly memorize them
