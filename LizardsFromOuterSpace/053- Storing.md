# Storing
Storing is the process of recording information for future reference. The two important aspects of storage are the medium ([[028- Mediums of Information Management]]) and workflow. The medium is where you store your notes. Do you write it on a clay tablet, piece of papyrus, note card, or note taking app? The workflow is the process you stick to for recording your notes and any rules you follow. In the [[002- Zettelkasten]], a workflow rule would be the principle of atomicity, where you keep a note small enough to allow an idea to be referenced elsewhere. See [[009- Note Size]].
