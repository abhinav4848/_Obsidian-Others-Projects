# Structure

is the arrangement of and relations between the parts or elements of something complex**.**

“Common types of structure include [hierarchies](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hierarchy) (a cascade of one-to-many relationships), a [networks](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Complex_network) featuring many-to-many [links](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Link_(geometry)), or [latticeworks](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Lattice_(order)) featuring connections between components that are neighbors in space” - [Wikipedia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Structure) 

The key idea to understand about structure is that it allows for order, which in turn leads to repeatability. Everything is meaningless without repeatability. Mathematics is the language of patterns, which themselves are connections ([094- Connections (knowledge)](094-%20Connections%20(knowledge).md)) that repeat.
