# Zettelkasten and Structure

Note Taking is about storing information for later retrieval because we have a limited memory. Inherent in the process of storage is structure. In the case of a paper zettelkasten, the base structure would take the form of writing notes on paper and just putting them in a giant pile. The point of structure is to add **order** so that you can repeat tasks ([[041- Applicability]]) such as retrieval ([[007- Structuring for Retrieval]]) of a note. 

The above example would be an undesirable structure as it would take a long time to retrieve the note you are looking for. It would still be better then chaos, where your notes are scattered across a city, written in random places and mediums (chalk on ground, spelled out in someoneâ€™s mowed lawn, stored on a bubble gum wrapper in the dump).

Instead we add [[066- Layers of structure]] that facilitate retrieval. [[002- Zettelkasten]], in a sense, is just a very particular set layers. Part of the issue with the discussion around zettelkasten is that the term (note box) is very broad and the set of layers differs depending on who you talk to. For teaching others zettelkasten, I take what I see as the core layers of structure used by Luhmann and either adopt or adapt them for a digital medium.
