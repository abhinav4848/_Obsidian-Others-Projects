# Forming Knowledge
To work ([[068- Knowledge work]]) with knowledge ([[073- Knowledge]]), you first must **form information in your mind** . While this may seem quite obvious to you, there are good and bad ways of doing this. Improving this skill will help you learn quicker and form a more useful understanding of the world.

You want to avoid rote memorization, going for precision memorization (19d2a) instead. Then you want to organize ([[052- Structure building framework]]) the memorized information ([[073- Knowledge]]into a useful working mental model ([[058- Mental Models]]).
