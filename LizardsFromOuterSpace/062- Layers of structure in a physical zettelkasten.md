# Layers of structure in a physical zettelkasten

When you build a [002- Zettelkasten](002-%20Zettelkasten.md) you are adding [066- Layers of structure](066-%20Layers%20of%20structure.md) to facilitate note retrieval.

1. **The first layer** is creating a unified medium of storage such that it makes physical storage of the information manageable. Since paper is the most common form of writing, that is a good starting point. I could technically implement it using crayons and the walls of my house but that’d be subpar (still better than chaos).
2. **The second layer** is having a central storage point. I don’t leave my slips of paper all over the house or town because that would make the retrieval of the note a pain in the ass. Instead I put them in the same container/cabinet.
3. **Third layer** is having the notes on a restricted size of paper. Luhmann used pieces of paper in [DIN-A-6 format](https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/nachlass/zettelkasten). Others prefer using card stock. 
4. **Fourth layer** is having [unique identifiers](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Unique_identifier), which in turn allows you to point towards another piece of relevant information in any given note. Basically allows you to create connections ([094- Connections (knowledge)](094-%20Connections%20(knowledge).md)).
5. **Fifth Layer** is using a branching system for the unique identifiers instead of a sequential system. Luhmann did not do Thematic Branching with his IDs, where you are essentially creating a thematic tree structure. Instead his branching was arbitrary.
