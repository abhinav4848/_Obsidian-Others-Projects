# Summarizing 
is the process of creating a brief [[040- Generalization]] of a body of information. It is a [[066- Layers of structure]] that allows us to more easily process a body of information, creating a very shallow [[044- Model]] in the process.

Summarizing is one of the ways to deal with "infoglut". The other being the creation of [[092- Structure]]s that allow you to search ([[096- Selecting]]) the information.
