**Niklas Luhmann** was a German sociologist during the 20th century who is known for his prolific writing and work towards creating a theory of society. He created two [[002- Zettelkasten]]s over his career, starting the first one as a response to the need for an effective way to organize notes for the long term ([Johannes F.K. Schmidt, 2018 5](https://sociologica.unibo.it/article/view/8350/8270)).

The reason he is so popular among the zettelkasten community is because [his zettelkasten](https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_1_NB_1_1_V) is public, the focus of a [long term university research project](https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/), was part of his prolific output, and has a [book](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/34507927-how-to-take-smart-notes) written about it.

> The notes are characterized by a clearly sociological-conceptual, theoretically and methodologically controlled access to a large number of publications from a wide variety of scientific disciplines. In terms of theoretical history, the new beginning with the development of a theory of administration may have taken place; The programmatic formulation on the first slip of this collection is paradigmatic for a fresh start:

### **Department Overview**

> The **overview created by the NL Archives** is based on the structure of the collection with its 108 thematic departments (as well as the four register departments) specified by Luhmann and provides a further breakdown within the individual thematic departments based on Luhmann’s priorities on the respective notes.

> Therefore, the number structure does not represent a hierarchical structure. The departmental overviews **do not** claim to be complete (thematic or numerical).

> Luhmann himself has not created a detailed overview of the contents of the collection. For ZK I there is only a [department overview 1](https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/zettel/ZK_2_TU1_001_V) without further internal differentiation

[source - section 4.1](https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/bestand/zettelkasten/tutorial)

**Summary** - It looks like Luhmann did not use detailed categories but instead had a somewhat vague overview of the different departments. What keeps it from going into the realm of traditional categories is that he did not further differentiate with subcategories.
