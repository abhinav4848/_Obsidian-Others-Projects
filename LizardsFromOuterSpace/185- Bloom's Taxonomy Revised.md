# Bloom’s Taxonomy Revised
Bloom’s Taxonomy Revised is a set of learning objectives used by theorists and researchers. You can think of our brains as information processing machines. Your zettelkasten can be framed in the same way, except it serves as an external machine.

The key mental functions you engage in for learning are ([[174- Zettelkasten is Learning]]): remembering, understanding ([[186- Understanding]]), applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. The goal is to be able to engage in these functions with the four different types of knowledge: factual, conceptual, procedural, and metacognitive.
