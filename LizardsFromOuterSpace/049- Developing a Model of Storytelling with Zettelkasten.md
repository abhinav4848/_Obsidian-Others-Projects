# Developing a Model of Storytelling w/ Zettelkasten
If you are a writer or screenwriter, you can use the [[002- Zettelkasten]] to develop an external model ([[044- Model]]) of “what makes a good story” and “why we tell stories” over a span of 14 years (or lifetime because your zettelkasten doesn’t disappear).

### Example Timeline

**2005** - _Save The Cat! The Last Book on Screenwriting You’ll Ever Need_ - You read your first book on storytelling while taking a class on screen writing in college and build a basic [[044- Model]] around how to tell a good story.

**2009** - _Story: Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting_ - Four years later you come across another book on screenwriting and add information from it that is new and enriches your model developed back in 2005.

**2012** - _The Storytelling Animal: How Stories Make Us Human_ - same process as before, but instead this time you are fleshing out the reasons why we like story more so than what makes a good story.

**2015** - _Screen Writing 101 by Film Crit Hulk_

**2019** - _The Science of Storytelling_ - In a sense this is a good book that you could develop in the zettelkasten because it draws heavily on many different fields of social science to explain “the science of storytelling”. So you could imagine the author reading different social science books, textbooks, and research papers over the years. Then when he hit a critical mass of notes around the subject “science behind storytelling”, he coalesced them and wrote a book about it.

**During this time, you can also read other nonfiction books, integrating their lessons on society and human nature into your notes on how stories work**
