> Historically, work on tools for thought has focused principally on cognition; much of the work has been stuck in Spock-space.

Mnemonic video is a promising vehicle for such explorations, possibly combining both deep emotional connection with the detailed intellectual mastery the mnemonic medium aspires toward.
