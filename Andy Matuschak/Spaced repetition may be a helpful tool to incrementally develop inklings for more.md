# Spaced repetition may be a helpful tool to incrementally develop inklings

I’m often struck by an interesting question or notion in conversation or on a walk. In many cases, I can’t write anything terribly insightful on that topic in that moment: I certainly can’t write a good [[Evergreen notes]]. I don’t have anything useful to say about the notion yet—it just seems awfully interesting.

What action should I take now? How can I arrange to develop that inkling over time? I could create a “to-do” or block out time to think about this question, but that’s often not what’s called for. Instead, often what I need is marination: let’s come back in a few days, see what bubbles up.

I can capture the notion in [[A writing inbox for transient and incomplete notes]], but it’ll rapidly become a pile of unwieldy scraps which I’ll come to ignore ([[Inboxes only work if you trust how they’re drained]]).

[[Spaced repetition systems can be used to program attention]], so such mechanisms might be helpful here. In such a system, I might:

- Sit down to my morning writing and see a small handful of writing prompts for the day, drawn from my writing inbox
- I can choose to append whatever’s top of mind about any of them (perhaps they obscure what was written previously until I’ve added new material)
- Once I’ve done that, I can mark the prompt as “fruitful,” meaning it’ll come up again relatively soon, or “unfruitful,” in which case the system will increase its interval substantially.
- Alternately, I might take a moment to convert one of these prompts into one or more [[Evergreen notes]].
- Any prompts which I simply ignore will have their intervals increased, but perhaps not as substantially as explicitly-unfruitful prompts.

By taking advantage of the exponential nature of spaced repetition intervals, one could make incremental progress on potentially hundreds of prompts, while considering only a few on any given day.

This would represent a system for _incremental thinking._
