# Spaced repetition memory systems offer a generalized medium and context for practice

If your creative and intellectual goals are incredibly focused, then you can generally find a more compelling and effective way to practice than a [Spaced Repetition memory system](Spaced%20Repetition%20memory%20system.md). For instance, if you’re trying to learn a foreign language, you might seek out literature or films at your reading level and consume that instead—that would probably be much more interesting. But one of the big advantages of existing SRMs is that they’re fully general. If you can write a practice task for it, you can toss it into the bucket with everything else. And if you have a review habit, you’ll end up practicing it. You don’t have to start a new habit to make it happen. This generality is a key part of [[Spaced repetition memory systems make memory a choice]].

It’s interesting to ponder, though, whether/how one might incrementally specialize systems like Anki for better targeted practice. Plugins and custom note types are a step in this direction. I believe we can probably do much, much better.
