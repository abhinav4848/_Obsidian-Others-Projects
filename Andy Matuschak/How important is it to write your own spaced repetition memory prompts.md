# How important is it to write your own spaced repetition memory prompts?
Writing prompts is a form of [[Self-explanation]]. Non-trivial prompt-writing will generally promote deeper processing of the text. It often involves *construction*, i.e. when prompts include inferences which aren’t strictly in the text. And it can involve *integration*, i.e. when a prompt draws connections between different parts of the text, or between the text and prior knowledge. Writing prompts can also be *error-correcting*: you may notice that you find yourself confused, or that you don’t understand the idea well enough to explain it.

Apart from these effects, writing prompts likely produces more reliable memory of any particular item, via [[Elaborative encoding]] effects.

> The act of constructing an Anki card is itself nearly always a form of elaborative encoding. It forces you to think through alternate forms of the question, to consider the best possible answers, and so on. I believe this is true for even the most elementary cards. And it certainly becomes true if you construct more complex cards, cards relating the basic fact to be remembered to other ideas (like the Telstar-ASCII link), gradually building up a web of richly interrelated ideas.
