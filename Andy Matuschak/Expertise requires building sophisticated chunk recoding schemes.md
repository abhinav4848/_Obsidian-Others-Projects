In many fields, experts become experts mostly by developing more sophisticated mental representations ([Mental representations, after Ericsson and Pool](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zSQhVMNeFNGfggB9Pg6MMDX)), which amounts to increasing the size of their mental chunks ([[Chunks in human cognition]]). This increases their information processing capacity ([[Human channel capacity increases with bits-per-chunk]], [[Recoding can increase chunk size]]). This happens through practice: [[Good practice encodes more effective chunk recoding schemes]]

> What sets expert performers apart from everyone else is the quality and quantity of their mental representations.

(Ericsson and Pool, 2016, p. 62, not well-cited)

For example, the model developed by Simon and Gilmartin (1973) suggests that chess masters have encoded order tens of thousands of chunks. (See also [Chase and Simon - Perception in chess](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zS64tidr4brqfuEo5xs2ySy))

[Knowledge work often requires solving search problems](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2t9jQbyU3uDb5crGY29C5z). Ericsson and Pool suggest that expert search performance comes from more complex chunk schemas (2016, p. 70-72). The argument’s not made very strongly, but because [Human channel capacity increases with bits-per-chunk](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zRTbHLYsFnL2hThAZL6tVqD), this would seem to explain superior culling and feedback-uptake performance.
