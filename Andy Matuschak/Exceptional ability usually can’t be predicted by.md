# **Exceptional ability usually can‚Äôt be predicted by general ability tests**

- ‚ÄúCreativity ratings‚Äù of professional architects, mathematicians, and scientists, assigned by a survey of professors, were not significantly correlated with IQ ({MacKinnon}, {1968}). However, entering these professions seems to require high IQ: {98%} of the {140} people covered by the study had IQs in the range {118}-{140}.
- Master-level chess skill doesn‚Äôt seem to be associated with the results of psychometric tests in adults (see review in Grabner et al, 2006)
    - ‚Ä¶ though they are in children!
    - And there have been only a few, low-sized studies of this association.
- Musical ability is weakly correlated with psychometric tests (see review in Shuter-Dyson, 1968, p. 308-311)
    - This data mostly concerns broad populations, rather than people of exceptional ability.
- Acquired skill in touch typing can‚Äôt be predicted from pertaining aptitude tests

This evidence bears on¬†[To what extent is exceptional ability heritable?](To%20what%20extent%20is%20exceptional%20ability%20heritable.md)¬†to the extent that performance on the constituent ability tests is heritable.
