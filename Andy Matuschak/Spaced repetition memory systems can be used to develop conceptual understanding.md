# **Spaced repetition memory systems make memory a choice**

Memory is normally something which happens by chance. Often, it feels a bit like the object of a helpless prayer: you might be reading a book, and think to yourself “oh boy, I’d better remember this.”

One fascinating consequence of using a [Spaced Repetition memory system](Spaced%20Repetition%20memory%20system.md) is that they **make memory a choice.** Once you’ve adopted a memory practice, if you want to remember something, you can simply cause it to happen: just take a few moments to write a question about it. Over the next few weeks, you’ll encode it durably into long-term memory. Moreover, it’ll only take you a few minutes cumulatively: [Spaced repetition memory systems are extremely efficient](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z64yjxVfMvJTSAjWFpyEtnA). So not only do these systems make memory a choice, but they make the choice very low-stakes: [Deciding to remember something with a spaced repetition system is (aspirationally) a lightweight gesture](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4ipbCkPaf5wwDkpgqUFgTg).

This radically changes one’s relationship with memory! [Core practices in knowledge work are often ad-hoc](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zPFYKBrsvL88opKh28UYxWv), and “remembering details” is a good example of a typically ad-hoc practice. But spaced repetition memory systems are an authentic [Executable strategy](Executable%20strategy.md) for remembering specific details.

I often visualize this property embodied in a magic wand. When you feel an impulse of interest arise within you, you just point the magic wand at the object, and you’ll remember it effortlessly. It’s a tool which serves your intellectual excitement.

One of the important pieces here is that you can use the same “move” with basically anything: [Spaced repetition memory systems offer a generalized medium and context for practice](Spaced%20repetition%20memory%20systems%20offer%20a%20generalized%20medium%20and%20context%20for%20practice.md).

They’re *not* as great a strategy for solving [People seem to forget most of what they read, and they mostly don’t notice](People%20seem%20to%20forget%20most%20of%20what%20they%20read,%20and%20they%20mostly%20don't%20notice.md), since it’s quite effortful to choose the details to remember and to write effective questions for an entire text. This is where the [Mnemonic medium](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zKPv6qkSErdRGqyryvgS2wS) aspires to help.
