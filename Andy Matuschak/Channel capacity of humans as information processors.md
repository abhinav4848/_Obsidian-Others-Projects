# Channel capacity of humans as information processors

One way to examine the limits of human information processing is to ask how much information can a person can reproduce from some stimulus they observe. In this framing, we can model the observer as a communications channel using tools from information theory. This figure (Pollack, 1953, p. 422) depicts the model:

A perfect communications channel could reproduce any input you gave it. In practice, most channels (including humans) produce more errors as inputs contain more information. The behavior is usually asymptotic: a channel transmits its input perfectly until some threshold. Past that threshold, which we call the _{channel capacity}_, the correlation between outputs and inputs falls, and the total number of bits of transmitted information remains constant.

Experiments on human [Span of absolute judgment](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zMQK1sFXWbVMbSQAsjSTUvm) can be used to model humans in this way. Miller’s review (1956) of the empirical data suggested that human channel capacity for unidimensional stimuli is about {2.6} bits.

For example, here’s a figure from Miller (1956, p. 83), using experimental data from Pollack (1952, 1953) on human absolute judgment of pitches, reframed with an information-theoretic approach.

Q. If you know a subject’s span of absolute judgment (for single-item, unidimensional magnitudes), how would you find their channel capacity?  
A. channel capacity = log_2(span of absolute judgment)

Q. Why is the span of absolute judgment related to human channel capacity by a log_2 relation?  
A. Channel capacity is expressed in bits. If the span of absolute judgment is 8 categories, you need log_2(8) bits to represent every state.
