# **The mnemonic medium may push readers to read more slowly and attentively**

In interviews,¬†[Quantum Country](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zNVVrcxnkjk7pCabiBvaic1)¬†readers have variously told us that the embedded questions ([Mnemonic medium prompts are interleaved into the reading experience](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zTzb8spnoqzxs3mkvPKprmn)) push them to read more carefully, or that the questions help them notice when their focus isn‚Äôt sharp. Leaving aside the direct effect of the prompts on memory, the¬†[Mnemonic medium](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zKPv6qkSErdRGqyryvgS2wS)‚Äôs questions may simply help readers slow down and pay attention when they read.¬†[Understanding requires effortful engagement](Understanding%20requires%20effortful%20engagement.md), so this effect may produce deeper understanding. Or more simply, it may promote basic reading comprehension:¬†[People often struggle to remember details of prose text because they never processed them in the first place](People%20often%20struggle%20to%20remember%20details%20of%20prose%20text%20because%20they%20never%20processed%20them%20in%20the%20first%20place.md). 

It‚Äôs not clear whether this fully explains the general finding that¬†[Asking people questions while they read a text improves performance on untested contents](Asking%20people%20questions%20while%20they%20read%20a%20text%20improves%20performance%20on%20untested%20contents.md), or whether there‚Äôs some other mechanism in play there.

The review areas also create natural pauses in the reading experience, somewhat similar to¬†[Eckhart Tolle‚Äôs pause symbol](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zGoV53S3PbYbJGjYCkNSV4Q), but perhaps not so reflective.

The flip side of this property is that the medium¬†*demands*¬†more attention than a typical written medium. Being pushed to read more slowly and attentively will feel unpleasant if you aren‚Äôt trying to engage in high-attention reading. See e.g.¬†[The initial mnemonic medium is implicitly authoritarian in premise](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zR5H2t4iYJECveXmu1DnYvS);¬†[The mnemonic medium should give readers control over the prompts they collect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8kPkXQZ3wVR5DfJ79uhnuz).

It would be interesting to empirically compare the amount of time readers spend on an essay with and without questions, subtracting off the amount of time mnemonic medium readers spend directly engaged with questions. Eye-tracking data would be interesting tool.

There‚Äôs plenty of prior art for this kind of mechanism in CAI systems; see e.g.¬†[Anderson, T. H., Anderson, R. C., Dalgaard, B. R., Wietecha, E. J., Biddle, W. B., Paden, D. W., Smock, H. R., Alessi, S. M., Surber, J. R., & Klemt, L. L. (1974). A computer based study management system. Educational Psychologist, 11(1), 36‚Äì45](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zFSbK7EzPkgZ2DgSve1d3rr).
