# Writing good spaced repetition memory prompts is hard
People regard flashcards as something trivial from their school days, so they don’t take writing them very seriously. But it’s awfully hard to write good prompts for a [[Spaced repetition memory system]]. For example, good prompts:

- access an idea from multiple angles
- capture one precise thought (likely reflective of [[Chunks in human cognition]])
- avoid unintentional ambiguity
- are concise
- get to what really matters about the topic, not just what’s easy to memorize

For more, see: [[Important attributes of good spaced repetition memory prompts]] 

## It’s harder than people think

Unfortunately, it’s not obvious when the prompts you’ve written are bad, so people often don’t realize that their prompts are bad. This can cause them to underrate the performance or overrate the tedium of spaced repetition memory practice.

## It’s taxing even if you know how

Even if one develops the skill to write good prompts, it’s quite time-consuming and cognitively taxing to do it. I believe that this is another significant barrier to widespread adoption.

One solution: [The mnemonic medium supplies expert-authored prompts to remove the burden of prompt-writing](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zPkuLaEFFPqkcWpLcPzbW6i).
