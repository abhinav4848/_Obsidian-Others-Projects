_Evergreen notes_ are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time, across projects. This is an unusual way to think about writing notes: [[Most people take only transient notes]]. That’s because these practices aren’t about writing notes; they’re about effectively developing insight: [[Better note-taking misses the point; what matters is “better thinking”]]. When done well, these notes can be quite valuable: [[Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work]]

It’s hard to write notes that are worth developing over time. These principles help:

- [[Evergreen notes should be atomic]]
- [[Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented]]
- [[Evergreen notes should be densely linked]]
- [[Prefer associative ontologies to hierarchical taxonomies]]
- [[Write notes for yourself by default, disregarding audience]]

This concept is of course enormously indebted to the notion of a [[Andy Matuschak/Zettelkasten]] Zettelkasten. See [[Similarities and differences between evergreen note-writing and Zettelkasten]].

## Implementing an evergreen note practice

> Many students and academic writers think like the early ship owners when it comes to note-taking. They handle their ideas and findings in the way it makes immediate sense: If they read an interesting sentence, they underline it. If they have a comment to make, they write it into the margins. If they have an idea, they write it into their notebook, and if an article seems important enough, they make the effort and write an excerpt. Working like this will leave you with a lot of different notes in many different places. Writing, then, means to rely heavily on your brain to remember where and when these notes were written down.
