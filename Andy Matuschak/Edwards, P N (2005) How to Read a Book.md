General advice on how to read non-fiction effectively. Comments related to [[Write about what you read to internalize texts deeply]]; [[Skilful reading is often non-linear]]; [[The best way to read is highly contextual]].

The author’s focus is on efficient and effective reading. You should be able to read a 300 page book in 6-8 hours, understand the key points, and perform some initial analysis, though you won’t necessarily have internalized all the details.

He suggests three passes over the book’s content: {overview, focused on getting a general picture, marking important passages, generating questions} ({10%} time); {detailed, for a careful, critical grasp} ({60%} time); {notes, to support recall and synthesis} ({30%} time).

To understand a book’s intellectual context, he suggests to determine what, and who, {it is *answering*}.
