# **Spaced repetition systems can be used to program attention**

[Spaced repetition memory systems make memory a choice](Spaced%20repetition%20memory%20systems%20make%20memory%20a%20choice.md), but the computerized component‚Äôs value lies specifically in dynamically scheduling and selecting questions to be reviewed. In some sense, the efficacy of a¬†[Spaced Repetition memory system](Spaced%20Repetition%20memory%20system.md)¬†comes from its power to¬†*program your attention*¬†([Programmable attention](Programmable%20attention.md)). Think: ‚Äú{cron} for your mind.‚Äù 

Manually making decisions about which cards to review would be far too taxing on a per-card basis. The transaction cost is too high. When that work is mostly outsourced, you can make a coarser decision‚Äîto devote your attention to SRS practice for 10 minutes‚Äîand then let your attention be directed by the machine within that block.

Systematically, we can generalize spaced repetition to:

- a priority queue of microtasks
    - (for memory tasks, in SM-2: a simple due date)
- an interactive environment which presents sufficiently high-priority tasks
    - (for memory tasks, a flashcard UI which shows ‚Äúdue‚Äù cards)
- feedback actions which modify a task‚Äôs subsequent priority
    - (for memory tasks, forgotten / remember modify the next due interval)

Within a traditional flashcard-style system, you can use this observation to go far beyond memorization: see¬†[Spaced repetition memory systems can be used to prompt application, synthesis, and creation](Spaced%20repetition%20memory%20systems%20can%20be%20used%20to%20prompt%20application,%20synthesis,%20and%20creation.md)¬†and¬†[Spaced repetition may be a helpful tool to develop or change habits](Spaced%20repetition%20may%20be%20a%20helpful%20tool%20to%20develop%20or%20change%20habits.md).¬†[Spaced repetition prompt design is about designing tasks for your future self](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z53zJy6y76MGuJuWW4Qvab9). 

But the core¬†*concept*‚Äîautomatically arranging and presenting tasks according to some expanding schedule‚Äîcan be instantiated in many interfaces and domains. I call this notion¬†[Spaced everything](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z9hscgkG2TeqgUtu3vAEW3U).

As a pianist, I have a huge number of technical exercises that I maintain: e.g. scales, argpeggios, and patterns played in variations across each key. I only want to work on exercises for 20-30 minutes a day. Which ones should I do? You can imagine a system which:

- keeps track of each exercise, including axes of variation (blocked, arpeggiated; keys; modes)
    - priority is a function of both recency and the previous maximum tempo I achieved, relative to my target tempo
- presents a prioritized queue of 20-30 minutes worth of exercises
    - perhaps the exercise durations are estimated by measuring my practice
    - perhaps it can be configured to present at most 5 variations of any single exercise, to ensure breadth
- solicits feedback from me in terms of a subjective rating and/or a maximum tempo marking

It‚Äôs interesting to imagine a single interface malleable enough that I could define my piano exercises above as one sort of routine, and a SRS memory system as another routine‚Äîboth special cases of a single general primitive.
