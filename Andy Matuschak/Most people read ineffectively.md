# Most people read ineffectively
[[Knowledge work should accrete]], but most reading does not

- [[People seem to forget most of what they read, and they mostly don't notice]] 
- [[People often struggle to remember details of prose text because they never processed them in the first place]] 
- [[Evergreen note-writing helps reading efforts accumulate]], but most people don’t do this
- Of those that do, [[Note-writing practices are generally ineffective]]
- However! [[The most effective readers and thinkers I know don’t take notes when reading]]

[[Skilful reading is often non-linear]], but most people read linearly
