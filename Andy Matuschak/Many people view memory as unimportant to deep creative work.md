# Many people view memory as unimportant to deep creative work
When telling others that [[Spaced repetition memory systems make memory a choice]], people often react quite negatively: “What’s the point of memorizing all that stuff? Rote knowledge isn’t what matters: I want conceptual understanding, creativity, artistry, etc!”

One response to this is to point out that in fact, [[Spaced repetition memory systems can be used to develop conceptual understanding]]. But it’s also important to take seriously the claims against the value of memorization. Some responses there:

- [[Basic cognitive tasks rely on memory]]
