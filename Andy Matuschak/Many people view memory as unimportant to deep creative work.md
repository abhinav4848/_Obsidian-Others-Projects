# **Many people view memory as unimportant to deep creative work**

When telling others that¬†[Spaced repetition memory systems make memory a choice](Spaced%20repetition%20memory%20systems%20make%20memory%20a%20choice.md), people often react quite negatively: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point of memorizing all that stuff? Rote knowledge isn‚Äôt what matters: I want conceptual understanding, creativity, artistry, etc!‚Äù

One response to this is to point out that in fact,¬†[Spaced repetition memory systems can be used to develop conceptual understanding](Spaced%20repetition%20memory%20systems%20can%20be%20used%20to%20develop%20conceptual%20understanding.md). But it‚Äôs also important to take seriously the claims against the value of memorization. Some responses there:
