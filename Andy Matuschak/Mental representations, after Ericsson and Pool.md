# Mental representations, after Ericsson and Pool
Ericsson and Pool (2016) use the term “mental representations” as vernacular shorthand for the chunking schema ([[Chunks in human cognition]]) a person uses in some domain ([[Efficient chunk schemas usually encode domain-specific attributes]]).

Mental representations matter because information processing capacity varies with their complexity. [[Human channel capacity increases with stimulus dimensionality]] and [[Human channel capacity increases with bits-per-chunk]].

> … mental representations … make it possible to process large amounts of information quickly, despite the limitations of short-term memory … one could define a mental representation as a conceptual structure designed to sidestep the usual restrictions that short-term memory places on mental processing.

(Ericsson and Pool, 2016, p. 61)
