# Non-identification

It is possible to notice an impulse, thought, desire, aversion, concern, etc, without *identifying with* that sensation. That is: the relationship can become “I sense a feeling of impatience” (akin to hearing a sound from the street outside), rather than “I’m impatient” or even “I can’t believe this is taking so long” ([[Everything takes longer than you think it will]]). This practice is not about *ignoring* impulses—you still sense them and can choose to act on them—but rather about making them an object rather than a subject, removing them from the driver’s seat, etc.

This is a practice I learned from Buddhism, though I imagine it’s a part of many contemplative traditions.

    Your title ≠ Your job ≠ Your work ≠ What you do ≠ Who you are
    Kegan’s slippery career slope
    1.  I am my title
    2. I am my job, I have a title
    3. I am my work, I have a job with a title
    4. I am what I do, I have work to do in a job with a title
    5. I am, I have doings
