# Most people take only transient notes
In contrast to [Evergreen Notes](Evergreen%20Notes%208b05f5bf420f4caaad50f6fea2828638.md), [Most people use notes as a bucket for storage or scratch thoughts](Most%20people%20use%20notes%20as%20a%20bucket%20for%20storage%20or%20scratch%20thoughts.md). These are very convenient to write, but after a year of writing such notes, they’ll just have a pile of dissociated notes. The notes won’t have added up to anything: they’re more like fuel, written and discarded to help the author process their ongoing experiences. 

Fleeting Notes are valuable scratchpads to temporarily support working memory, but [Knowledge work should accrete](Knowledge%20work%20should%20accrete.md), so we should view them as “messy-thought” inputs for the “neat-thought” notes they’ll inform (Khoe).

This is one reason why [[Note-writing practices are generally ineffective]].
