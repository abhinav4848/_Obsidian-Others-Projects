# Most people take only transient notes
In contrast to [[Andy Matuschak/Evergreen Notes|Evergreen Notes]], [[Most people use notes as a bucket for storage or scratch thoughts]]. These are very convenient to write, but after a year of writing such notes, they’ll just have a pile of dissociated notes. The notes won’t have added up to anything: they’re more like fuel, written and discarded to help the author process their ongoing experiences. 

Fleeting Notes are valuable scratchpads to temporarily support working memory, but [[Knowledge work should accrete]], so we should view them as “messy-thought” inputs for the “neat-thought” notes they’ll inform (Khoe).

This is one reason why [[Note-writing practices are generally ineffective]].
