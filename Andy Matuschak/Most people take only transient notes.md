# **Most people take only transient notes**

In contrast to [Evergreen Notes](Evergreen%20Notes%208b05f5bf420f4caaad50f6fea2828638.md), [Most people use notes as a bucket for storage or scratch thoughts](Most%20people%20use%20notes%20as%20a%20bucket%20for%20storage%20or%20scratch%20thoughts.md). These are very convenient to write, but after a year of writing such notes, they‚Äôll just have a pile of dissociated notes. The notes won‚Äôt have added up to anything: they‚Äôre more like fuel, written and discarded to help the author process their ongoing experiences.

[Fleeting Note](Fleeting%20Note%20d5e2031e3e8c477c9b1dc4bb19764bd0.md)s are valuable scratchpads to temporarily support working memory, but [Knowledge work should accrete](Knowledge%20work%20should%20accrete.md), so we should view them as ‚Äúmessy-thought‚Äù inputs for the ‚Äúneat-thought‚Äù notes they‚Äôll inform (Khoe).

This is one reason why [Note-writing practices are generally ineffective](Note-writing%20practices%20are%20generally%20ineffective.md).
