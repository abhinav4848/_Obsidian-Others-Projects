# Get curious
An exhortation. When I find myself lost in tiny details, focused on execution over wondering and big-picture questions, I try to remind myself to *get curious.* My default mode, having spent so many years as a technologist, is to focus on *tasks,* on *doing,* on *accomplishing.* That’s often necessary to meaningful intellectual creative work, but it’s certainly not sufficient. Too much doing-focus will crowd out the expansive mindset which generates new insights. [[It’s hard to hear yourself think]].

For example, when writing about how to formulate spaced repetition prompts to represent list-like knowledge, I noticed that I was working in a fairly dull-minded, execution-oriented fashion. The work felt lifeless. I realized that there are lots of open questions in what I was writing about, and reframed my work from “write down what I know fluently about this topic” to “try to answer: how is list-like knowledge learned, cognitively speaking? how *should* that type of knowledge be developed via spaced repetition systems?” I experienced a “flip” like the classic vase/face swap, and suddenly the work felt vital again: I was curious about the answers to those questions, and I pushed my understanding of the topic forward.
