# Methods for bringing dynamic mediums to physical reading contexts
One response to [[Reading texts on computers is unpleasant]] is to give up, to invert the problem: how to bring the properties of dynamic mediums to physical books?

- Projectors / cameras (a la [Dynamicland](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zDpmsw9zxmk2eXsoHVUqidf))
    - I like the notion of a wide-angle camera you can clip onto a book, just like you might clip on a little light for reading at night.
- Treat a phone or tablet as a “companion device”—it’s not where the reading happens, but it’s perhaps where dynamic supports appear.
- [[Voice-based interface]]
    - [Specifying book passages with a few spoken words](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zJxuTHe8PCELxMWhvzVxT8t)
