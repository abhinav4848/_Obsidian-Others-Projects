# Existing spaced repetition systems discourage evergreen notes

Though notes in a [[Spaced repetition memory system]] are atomic in the same way as [[Evergreen notes]] ([[Evergreen notes should be atomic]]), they’re in many ways _too_ atomized ([[Traditional spaced repetition memory prompts are atomized]]). The form discourages incremental synthesis and distillation.

The questions float in an undifferentiated mist, detached from any intrinsically meaningful context and not linked to relevant neighbors ([[Evergreen notes should be densely linked]]), and not especially meant to be accessed except within the review experience. They’re not meant to be durable, growing units; they’re meant to be disposable flotsam. All this could be fine, if they had a clear relationship with a separate system for [[Evergreen notes]], but they don’t.

Happily: [[The mnemonic medium can be extended to one’s personal notes]].

> I start to identify open problems, questions that I’d personally like answered, but which don’t yet seem to have been answered. I identify tricks, observations that seem pregnant with possibility, but whose import I don’t yet know. And, sometimes, I identify what seem to me to be field-wide blind spots. I add questions about all these to Anki as well. In this way, Anki is a medium supporting my creative research. It has some shortcomings as such a medium, since it’s not designed with supporting creative work in mind – it’s not, for instance, equipped for lengthy, free-form exploration inside a scratch space.
