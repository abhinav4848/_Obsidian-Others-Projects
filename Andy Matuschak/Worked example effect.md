# **Worked example effect**

Carefully studying worked examples may produce more learning than solving problems.

While the term “worked example effect” usually refers to comparisons of studying related worked examples to solving related problems, it’s sometimes discussed in comparison to the [Testing effect](Testing%20effect.md)—i.e. is it better to study related worked examples, or to engage in [Retrieval practice](Retrieval%20practice.md) by re-solving related problems? See e.g. Yeo and Fazio, 2019. [Jeffrey Karpicke](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6d4D1bSzhdaGpnAKGBX3FT) argues (see commentary on [van Gog, T., & Sweller, J. (2015). Not New, but Nearly Forgotten: The Testing Effect Decreases or even Disappears as the Complexity of Learning Materials Increases. Educational Psychology Review, 27(2), 247–264](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zMjGz9ddgwjxadBRxQCnnWY)) that “the worked-example experiments all failed to show retrieval practice effects because of the way retrieval practice was implemented” (i.e. immediate, massed, “requiring no episodic context reinstatement”).

# Questions

- Can schema acquisition be directly induced through e.g. a [Spaced Repetition memory system](Spaced%20Repetition%20memory%20system.md)?
    - [Yeo, D. J., & Fazio, L. K. (2019). The optimal learning strategy depends on learning goals and processes: Retrieval practice versus worked examples. Journal of Educational Psychology, 111(1), 73–90](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zLXN7M8jgARxLcNdTnWS4yU) suggests not, at least not just by repeated problem solving.
    - 
- How important is memory consolidation to schema acquisition? To put that another way, if you observe a schema pattern once, is it likely to be forgotten as quickly as, say, a simple fact? Is the challenge in schema acquisition mostly in *initially noticing* the patterns, or is an important part in *reinforcing* those insights once identified?
- What exactly is the daylight between the concept of a “schema” and the concept of a “chunk” ([Chunks in human cognition](Chunks%20in%20human%20cognition.md))?
    - Tentatively: schemas evolve over time while chunks do not; schemas involve not only the grouping of information but also the organization of that information into a larger structure or framework. Chunks are a somewhat narrower concept: they’re usually considered in the context of memory; while schemas are usually discussed in the broader contexts of information processing and problem solving.

    - For high [Element interactivity](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zBk3AaWYp4spoTbc1f5aYvC) material (modestly complex problem solving), the authors fail to find a [Testing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zTpJdbe6ub7uhBFLuHkFsrT) and instead find a [Worked example effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zD8D8PPRBDEFk3JeM2vaWrn): restudying isomorphic worked examples leads to better results on final test performance. This holds both when the [Retrieval practice](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zXA8c6XtMLgRCGwJFGnZUvw) involves solving isomorphic/identical problems and also when it involves simply recalling the text of the example solution.

    - If we’d like to control the cognitive load involved in learning tasks, we can minimize the extraneous cognitive load in various ways (see e.g. [Worked example effect](Worked%20example%20effect.md)). But we also need to moderate the intrinsic cognitive load.
    - Sweller points out that “while extraneous cognitive load can severely reduce instructional effectiveness, it may do so only when coupled with a high intrinsic cognitive load.” All the studies done at the time of this publication involved problems with high element interactivity. So, as an instructional designer, if you’re creating low-interactivity tasks, you may not have to worry about things like [Worked example effect](Worked%20example%20effect.md).

They extrapolate to suggest that [Desirable difficulties, after Bjork](Desirable%20difficulties,%20after%20Bjork.md) in general may be undesirable when element interactivity is high, by reasoning in terms of [Cognitive load theory](Cognitive%20load%20theory.md) and working memory availability. This logic may also explain the [Worked example effect](Worked%20example%20effect.md).

    - Having decreased cognitive load, you’ll want to focus learners’ attention on task aspects that facilitate schema acquisition. To help with that, you’ll want to eliminate extraneous elements of the task, or make sure that they’ll be automated away. Or you can provide [Cognitive scaffolding](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zWSH2QNUsrTGP4V15JBaaEv) in the form of worked examples ([Worked example effect](Worked%20example%20effect.md)) or partially completed problems.

    - Citing a 2004 review from Richard E. Mayer, it seems that empirical evidence repeatedly demonstrates that unguided approaches are ineffective. By contrast, students—particularly domain-novices—benefit from being “explicitly shown what to do and how to do it.“ ([Worked example effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zD8D8PPRBDEFk3JeM2vaWrn)). Problem solving is likely to be effective only when learners are sufficiently experienced.
    - It’s true that in e.g. [Sweller, J., & Cooper, G. A. (1985). The Use of Worked Examples as a Substitute for Problem Solving in Learning Algebra. Cognition and Instruction, 2(1), 59–89](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zYHdLJ7TFdpcwGtqDChMNbm), the [Worked example effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zD8D8PPRBDEFk3JeM2vaWrn) applies only to identical test problems.

- The author’s hypothesis was that [Transfer-appropriate processing](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6TYDg3hS2xeHNjpQdNHxss) would explain some of the experiments in which a [Worked example effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zD8D8PPRBDEFk3JeM2vaWrn) is observed rather than a testing effect: retrieval tasks need to be similar to the tasks they’re tested on.
