# Get playful
An exhortation closely related to [[Get curious]], but suited to moments of action.

Don’t worry about doing it “right,” don’t worry about “how long it’s taking me,” don’t worry about “solving” the problem or doing something “important.” Just enjoy the interaction with the problem and the impulses you feel relative to it. Act on those impulses; watch what happens; act on the new impulses. Turn up the temperature on the distribution.

# Examples
It’s hard not to think of someone like Jacob Collier when I think about this (see e.g. [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNCNFm17McA)). He seems to be living a constantly-playful life of musical exploration. I find it helpful to think about him as an exemplar here.
