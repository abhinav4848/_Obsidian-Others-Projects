# **Everything takes longer than you think it will**

… so choose projects and their scope much more carefully, Andy.

This manifests in a number of ways and presents a number of challenges.

One challenge is that because my projects are very long, I’m often torn between diving deep into some element of the project—which often leaves me feeling frustrated that everything else remains frozen—and spreading myself thin trying to make progress on a lot of things at once.

- Q. What antidote does Ken Kocienda suggest to the problem of feeling frustrated about not being able to achieve both depth and breadth in creative projects?
    
    A. The key question: What’s the most important thing I could be doing right now to make progress on the project? Do that. Don’t worry about the parts that remain frozen. If you keep answering the question, eventually, their time will come.
