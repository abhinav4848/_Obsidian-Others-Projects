# **Testing effect**

When you try to recall some detail from memory, that act strengthens your memory of that detail. When exploited as a learning activity, this is called [Retrieval practice](Retrieval%20practice.md). 

Experiment has demonstrated this effect even when the correct answer is not provided (though¬†[Retrieval practice may be less effective without feedback](Retrieval%20practice%20may%20be%20less%20effective%20without%20feedback.md)), and even when the test-taker is given ‚Äúopen-book‚Äù access to find a correct answer. The effect has been demonstrated in many fields and at many age levels.

This suggests a significantly different role for tests. In typical classrooms, teachers and students imagine that learning happens during lectures, or while reading the material. The tests are there to assess that learning. But in fact, the tests themselves are an important part of the learning process.

# Versus other study activities

Retrieval practice leads to more durable long-term memory than simply studying material by e.g. re-reading, despite the fact that students will be less successful during practice itself (Roediger, 2006).

It also seems to lead to more durable memory (Karpicke and Smith, 2012) and improved learning performance in general (Karpicke and Blunt, 2011) relative to¬†[Elaborative encoding](Elaborative%20encoding.md)-based practice alone.

# Format

The testing effect is generally measured to be more pronounced for production tests (short answer, essay) than for discrimination (multiple choice / true-false) (e.g. Kang et al, 2007). 

This may be due to the¬†[Generation effect](Generation%20effect.md).
