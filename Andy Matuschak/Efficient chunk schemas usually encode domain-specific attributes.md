# Efficient chunk schemas usually encode domain-specific attributes
As people develop more efficient chunks for some domain ([[Chunks in human cognition]], [[Recoding can increase chunk size]]), they often incorporate abstract, domain-specific attributes into their encodings. For instance, a chess master perceives chessboards in terms of “Pawn chains” and “attacking files” (Chase and Simon, 1973, p. 80)—rather than a bunch of positions of pieces. Their mental representation of the state of a game of chess is abstract, high-variance, high-dimensional, and relatively illegible to a novice. An improvising musician might think in terms of “tension” and “anticipation.”

These abstractions make the representations {less general} and {more difficult to transmit}, in exchange for {capturing more information within a particular domain}.

Ericsson and Pool use this observation to make a (likely too strong) generalization (2016, p. 60):

> … such mental representations … are very “domain specific” … This explains a critical fact about expert performance in general: there is no such thing as developing a general skill. You don’t train your memory; you train your memory for strings of digits or collections of words or for people’s faces.”
