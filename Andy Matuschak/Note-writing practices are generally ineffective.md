# **Note-writing practices are generally ineffective**

[Knowledge work should accrete](Knowledge%20work%20should%20accrete.md), but [**Most people take only transient notes**](Most%20people%20take%20only%20transient%20notes.md).

In part because [Note-writing practices provide weak feedback](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zUhd6Hb5dk35PPpnCHvd6bV), people don’t even notice how ineffective their note-writing practices are. They develop some baseline level of note-writing skill and mostly stay there ([People generally develop skills to a plateau and then stop](People%20generally%20develop%20skills%20to%20a%20plateau%20and%20then%20stop.md)). Expert performance is not well-defined, so it’s not obvious that people aren’t performing well ([Salience of improvement drives skill development](Salience%20of%20improvement%20drives%20skill%20development.md)). All this is true of other core knowledge work skills, too: [Core practices in knowledge work are often ad-hoc](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zPFYKBrsvL88opKh28UYxWv).

Much of what’s written about trying to improve these practices is misguided: [“Better note-taking” misses the point; what matters is “better thinking”](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zAf4oNSV9qB38ncSvYEZGAb)

By contrast: [Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zR6RRbCfY5rFkiimFnaJZKB)
