# Note-writing practices are generally ineffective

[Knowledge work should accrete](Knowledge%20work%20should%20accrete.md), but [[Most people take only transient notes.md|Most people take only transient notes]].

In part because [[Note-writing practices provide weak feedback]], people don’t even notice how ineffective their note-writing practices are. They develop some baseline level of note-writing skill and mostly stay there ([People generally develop skills to a plateau and then stop](People%20generally%20develop%20skills%20to%20a%20plateau%20and%20then%20stop.md)). Expert performance is not well-defined, so it’s not obvious that people aren’t performing well ([Salience of improvement drives skill development](<Salience of improvement drives skill development>)). All this is true of other core knowledge work skills, too: [[Core practices in knowledge work are often ad-hoc]]

Much of what’s written about trying to improve these practices is misguided: [[Better note-taking misses the point; what matters is “better thinking”]]

By contrast: [[Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work]]
