# **Spaced repetition may be a helpful tool to develop or change habits**

Imagine that you read an article which suggests something like this:

> Going around in circles with a challenging prioritization exercise? If none of the factors seems especially decisive on their own, you’re probably not going to get anywhere with a big pro/con table. You’ll need to either create new choices, identify more powerful axes of evaluation, or accept that you can’t make a strongly-informed choice.
> 

You could memorize pieces of this with a [Spaced Repetition memory system](Spaced%20Repetition%20memory%20system.md), but you can also use the same system to help “install” this habit in your mind. Here are some example questions you might try:

> Q: Recall a situation in which you went around in circles endlessly trying to prioritize various options. (Generate one you haven’t thought about before for this question)
> 
> 
> A: 
> 

> Q: Imagine an unusual series of concrete steps you might take next time you find yourself stuck in an unclear prioritization exercise. (Generate a series of steps that you haven’t generated before)
> 
> 
> A: 
> 

> Q: Imagine a specific situation in which you would have trouble escaping a prioritization quagmire by finding a single decisive factor. (Generate one you haven’t thought about before)
> 
> 
> A: 
> 

After you’ve answered this type of prompt about a specific habit a few times, it’s often helpful to make much more specific prompts to reinforce that habit. For example ([via Kanjun, 2020-07-01](https://twitter.com/kanjun/status/1278501271226298368)): “When I pick up my toothbrush in the morning…” “…get my phone and open Anki.”

This is an example of [[Spaced repetition systems can be used to program attention]].
