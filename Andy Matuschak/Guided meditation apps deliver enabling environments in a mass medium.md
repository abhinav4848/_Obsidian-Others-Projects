# Guided meditation apps deliver enabling environments in a mass medium

Much more than typical “learning apps,” a [[Guided meditation app]] is often a legitimate [[Enabling environment]].

- They’re generally focused on deeply meaningful growth (understanding the nature of mind and of being), rather than on skill-building: [[Enabling environments focus on creating opportunities for growth and action, not on skill-building]]
- They’re focused on actually _doing the thing_: [[Enabling environments focus on doing what’s enabled]]
- The activities aren’t some bitter pill you need to swallow: even early sessions fulfill an intrinsically meaningful purpose. [[Enabling environments’ activities directly serve an intrinsically meaningful purpose]].
- The teaching practices arose as a by-product of serious contemplatives’ own attempts to deeply understand: [[Powerful enabling environments usually arise as a byproduct of projects pursuing their own intrinsically meaningful purposes]].
    - Though these apps present easily-digestible forms of traditional practices, meditation methods are defined by the practice of experts, not of novices (e.g. contra grade school math): [[Powerful enabling environments focus on expert use]]
- [[Enacted experiences can bootstrap active participation in enabling environments]]; meditation apps do this: [[Guided meditation apps deliver enacted experiences in a mass medium]]
