# **Spaced repetition memory prompts should usually focus on one atomic unit**

If you‚Äôve just learned a new way to cook peas, you might write a prompt for a¬†[Spaced Repetition memory system](Spaced%20Repetition%20memory%20system.md)¬†like: ‚ÄúQ. How do I cook peas sous vide?‚Äù ‚ÄúA. 18m @ 70¬∞C‚Äù. But I find that questions like this are usually a struggle‚ÄîI‚Äôll frequently forget the answer. Questions which draw on multiple independent ideas seem to trip over this problem.

Why is it important that questions focus on one idea? Michael Nielsen (2018) suggests:

> I suspect it‚Äôs partly about focus. When I made mistakes with the combined question, I was often a little fuzzy about where exactly my mistake was. That meant I didn‚Äôt focus sharply enough on the mistake, and so didn‚Äôt learn as much from my failure. When I fail with the atomic questions my mind knows exactly where to focus.

What constitutes ‚Äúone idea‚Äù? That depends on your prior context; ‚Äúone idea‚Äù seems to consist of one step on top of whatever knowledge you‚Äôve already deeply internalized. Another way to look at that might be relative to¬†[Chunks in human cognition](Chunks%20in%20human%20cognition.md): a single idea is expressed in one ‚Äúchunk,‚Äù whatever that might mean for you.

The fix in such instances is simple: break the question down into multiple simpler questions. Then, perhaps, add another question which integrates those two simpler questions. (This seems like an opportunity for¬†[Spaced repetition and knowledge modeling](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zU1bKxJc9hY14jVWFXgPTJL)- *Empty note on Andy‚Äôs site*). The process of writing questions which focus precisely on one idea does seem to help sharpen my focus on the key elements of a topic (one angle on¬†[Writing one‚Äôs own spaced repetition prompts seems to promote understanding](Writing%20one‚Äôs%20own%20spaced%20repetition%20prompts%20seems.md)).

Wozniak (1999) supplies a good example (also demonstrating¬†[Spaced repetition memory prompts should be concise](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z9vSQjkBVL6dCVC6QhCu4Br)):

It is seven times as salty (30% by volume) as the ocean. Its density keeps swimmers afloat. Only simple organisms can live in its saline waters

Q. SRS prompts should usually focus on one atomic unit. How is ‚Äúone atomic unit‚Äù defined?

A. Depends on the complexity of your prior knowledge. One idea is a simple combination of chunks you‚Äôve already encoded.

Q. Why does MN think SRS prompts focused on more than one idea don‚Äôt work well?

A. When making a mistake with a combined question, it‚Äôs harder to focus sharply on exactly where the mistake was.
