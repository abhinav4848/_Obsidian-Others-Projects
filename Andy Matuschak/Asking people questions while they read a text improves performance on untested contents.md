# **Asking people questions while they read a text improves performance on untested contents**

Beyond the [[Testing effect]], answering questions while reading a text ([[Adjunct questions]]) promotes better *general* absorption, including of unrelated, untested material from the text. See references for more.

It’s possible that this is purely due to increased attention and focus: Rothkopf (1966) was able to achieve similar results on untested questions by simply admonishing students to read “slowly and carefully”.

Does this affect apply only to related-though-not-directly-tested material from the text, or to wholly unrelated material? It’s a bit unclear, but Hamaker (1986) suggests the effect is mostly concentrated in the former, with small effects measured under some conditions (higher-order questions, unrestricted time) for the latter.
