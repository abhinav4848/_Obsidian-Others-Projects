# **Asking people questions while they read a text improves performance on untested contents**

Beyond the¬†[Testing effect](Testing%20effect.md), answering questions while reading a text ([Adjunct questions](Adjunct%20questions.md)) promotes better¬†*general*¬†absorption, including of unrelated, untested material from the text. See references for more.

It‚Äôs possible that this is purely due to increased attention and focus: Rothkopf (1966) was able to achieve similar results on untested questions by simply admonishing students to read ‚Äúslowly and carefully‚Äù.

Does this affect apply only to related-though-not-directly-tested material from the text, or to wholly unrelated material? It‚Äôs a bit unclear, but Hamaker (1986) suggests the effect is mostly concentrated in the former, with small effects measured under some conditions (higher-order questions, unrestricted time) for the latter.
