# **Self-explanation effect**

Students who explain what they’re learning to themselves ([Self-explanation](Self-explanation.md)) perform better in subsequent recall, comprehension, and application tests. See main article Self-explanation for more.

Presumably related to [Generation effect](Generation%20effect.md), [Retrieval practice](Retrieval%20practice.md), and [Elaborative encoding](Elaborative%20encoding.md).
