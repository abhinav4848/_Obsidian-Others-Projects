# **Less accessible memories are more reinforced by retrieval**

Attempting to retrieve a memory which is hard to access will have a greater impact on subsequent retrieval attempts than attempting to retrieve a memory which is easy to access.

Stated as conjecture in [Robert A. Bjork](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zYPeHVeq311Jh4whSstyeFX) and Bjork (1992), synthesizing a body of empirical research reported elsewhere (which I’ve not surveyed).
