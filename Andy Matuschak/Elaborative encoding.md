# **Elaborative encoding**

‚ÄúElaborative encoding‚Äù describes what we do when we relate knowledge to existing memories or experiences. Making these connections is thought to improve recall, particularly when connections are made to especially distinctive and emotionally-connected targets.

It‚Äôs most often used in mnemonic methods, where people might remember numbers by relating them to celebrities, places, smells, etc.

Some¬†[Spaced Repetition memory system](Spaced%20Repetition%20memory%20system.md)¬†users explicitly write prompts to promote elaborative encoding. Experiments by Karpicke and Smith (2012) suggest this may not be adding much, vs. retrieval practice alone.
