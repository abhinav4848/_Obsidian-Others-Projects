The argument seems very related to the age-old ‚Äúinnovative vs. efficient thinking‚Äù debate mentioned in Chapter K of The ABCs of How We Learn ‚Äì in which the conclusion of their research was that both modes of thought are useful, and help each other when alternated, starting with innovative thought. Here‚Äôs a little refresher visual from the book:

In design, people alternate between being generative (e.g. ‚Äúencourage wild ideas!‚Äù in a brainstorm), and then focusing down using a more critical or pragmatic lens. This can also be called ‚Äúcreating choices vs. making choices.‚Äù I visualize the process of iteration: generating lots of design alternatives, then culling the options down using constraints. It seems like there are hundreds of diagrams of this.

    *A few more visualizations of the design process. The areas that show widening are generative phases, the narrowing are the moments of editing.*

Even creative restaurants that use fresh, local, seasonal ingredients need to have time during the day or at the beginning of the week to experiment with what the local market is providing. They generate new dishes to add to the seasonal menu. But when the doors of the restaurant open to customers, it‚Äôs time to focus down on flawless execution, not experimentation.

In mathematics, I‚Äôve noticed Federico Ardila and other mathematicians use both messy and neat thought ‚Äì sometimes even dividing the board or using separate notebooks. One area is for sketching and generating ideas or experimenting. The other is populated by the thoughts that emerge from the messy side, when they‚Äôre clear enough to form steps of a proof. At Asilomar, Max Ray talked about the pedagogical value of creating space for students to share what he (and others) call ‚Äúrough draft thinking‚Äù in math classes. This helps students understand how there are different ways to begin thinking about how to think about a problem, and ultimately be less afraid of just getting started.

When I spoke to humanities professors¬†Kim Kutz, David Rheinstrom and Eman Elshaikh at Khan Academy last week, they all nodded in strong agreement about how they generate initial thoughts on post-its, and¬†*then*¬†organize them before starting to write. The writing itself then goes through revision after revision. The time spent ‚Äúwriting‚Äù is actually mostly spent editing and revising. Research supports the value of revision in writing, which reminds me deeply of what we call¬†‚Äúiteration‚Äù in design:

‚ÄúRevision enables writers to muddle through and organize what they know in order to find a line of argument, to learn anew, and to discover what was not known before (Sommers, 1980)‚Äù ‚Äî from¬†Fitzgerald, Jill (1987). Research on Revision in Writing.¬†*Review of Educational Research (pp. 481-506)*.

So many endeavors ‚Äì we saw examples from writing, math, creative cooking, and design ‚Äì start with messy, rough, experimental thought and¬†*then*¬†focus down, usually going through cycles of revision and iteration.

Most of the time we hide that mess. Others only see the final show. They don‚Äôt see the countless hours of failed experiments and rehearsal. 

What might we build to support the messier stages of thought for students? Knowing that it‚Äôs absolutely normal to start messy is certainly a great lesson. It‚Äôs also great to understand how to systematically get to creative clarity by alternating generative and editorial mindsets.

We‚Äôre thinking about what we might built to better help with learning in the humanities. How lovely would it be if our UI could help capture messiness and iteration in a way that made it visible and actively encouraged?

Might that UI and functionality even extend to help other fields?

I‚Äôve been sketching a little bit in this realm, and am excited to share some early thoughts soon.

    - Book summary
        
        **Selected as one of NPR's Best Books of 2016, this book offers superior learning tools for teachers and students, from A to Z.**
        
        An explosive growth in research on how people learn has revealed many ways to improve teaching and catalyze learning at all ages. The purpose of this book is to present this new science of learning so that educators can creatively translate the science into exceptional practice. 
        
        The book is highly appropriate for the preparation and professional development of teachers and college faculty, but also parents, trainers, instructional designers, psychology students, and simply curious folks interested in improving their own learning. 
        
        Based on a popular Stanford University course, The ABCs of How We Learn uses a novel format that is suitable as both a textbook and a popular read. With everyday language, engaging examples, a sense of humor, and solid evidence, it describes 26 unique ways that students learn. Each chapter offers a concise and approachable breakdown of one way people learn, how it works, how we know it works, how and when to use it, and what mistakes to avoid. 
        
        The book presents learning research in a way that educators can creatively translate into exceptional lessons and classroom practice. The book covers field-defining learning theories ranging from behaviorism (R is for Reward) to cognitive psychology (S is for Self-Explanation) to social psychology (O is for Observation). 
        
        The chapters also introduce lesser-known theories exceptionally relevant to practice, such as arousal theory (X is for eXcitement). Together the theories, evidence, and strategies from each chapter can be combined endlessly to create original and effective learning plans and the means to know if they succeed.
