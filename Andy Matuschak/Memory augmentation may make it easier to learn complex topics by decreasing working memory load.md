# Memory augmentation may make it easier to learn complex topics by decreasing working memory load
[[Complex ideas may be hard to learn in part because their components overflow working memory]]. Given that [[Spaced repetition memory systems make memory a choice]], memory augmentation may be one interesting solution.

Related:
- The same notion, from a more emotional perspective: [[Memory augmentation can accelerate the unpleasant early stages of learning a subject]]
- A related claim, specifically about deep expertise:  [[Deep understanding requires detailed knowledge of fundamentals]]
- A possible part of an underlying mechanism here:  [[Learning increasingly complex ideas may amount to forming larger effective chunk sizes]]
- [[Cognitive load theory]] makes more general predictions about learning being more difficult in these contexts, beyond memory limitations
    - And in particular it suggests problems for topics with high [[Element interactivity]].
- Another possible mechanism: [[Forward testing effect]]
