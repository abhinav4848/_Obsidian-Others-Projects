# **Memory augmentation may make it easier to learn complex topics by decreasing working memory load**

[Complex ideas may be hard to learn in part because their components overflow working memory](Complex%20ideas%20may%20be%20hard%20to%20learn%20in%20part%20because%20their%20components%20overflow%20working%20memory.md). Given that [Spaced repetition memory systems make memory a choice](Spaced%20repetition%20memory%20systems%20make%20memory%20a%20choice.md), memory augmentation may be one interesting solution.

- A possible part of an underlying mechanism here: [Learning increasingly complex ideas may amount to forming larger effective chunk sizes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zV7JyZE547zrC5Wkm1iymGg)
- [Cognitive load theory](Cognitive%20load%20theory.md) makes more general predictions about learning being more difficult in these contexts, beyond memory limitations
    - And in particular it suggests problems for topics with high [Element interactivity](Element%20interactivity.md).
