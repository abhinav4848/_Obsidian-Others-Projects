# **Two-component model of memory**

This model of memory suggests that the decay of a memory over time can be accurately described by two parameters: {retrievability} and {stability}.

Retrievability is defined as the {probability of a person remembering a fact after a period of time}. Stability is defined as {the durability of the memory: how long it will last if not retrieved}. Their relationship is approximated by {`R ∝ exp(-t / S)`}.

Stability increases with each review, so that retrievability falls more slowly with each repetition (see [**Spacing effect**](Spacing%20effect.md)). Retrieval appears to increase stability more when retrievability is low: that is, [Less accessible memories are more reinforced by retrieval](Less%20accessible%20memories%20are%20more%20reinforced%20by%20retrieval.md) (see also [Desirable difficulties, after Bjork](Desirable%20difficulties,%20after%20Bjork.md)). [Supermemo](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2oUypiCEtPaDqNjbUsawCj) [tries to characterize this relationship with an exponential curve](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spacing_effect_gain), but the model complexity is high enough that I’m skeptical.

This model explains why it can be helpful to study even material which one can successfully recall (“overlearning”): even when retrieval strength is relatively high, study can increase storage strength, which will decrease subsequent retrieval strength decay ([Robert A. Bjork](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zYPeHVeq311Jh4whSstyeFX) and Bjork, 1992).

In practical use as part of a [Spaced Repetition memory system](Spaced%20Repetition%20memory%20system.md), a third parameter for item complexity must generally be introduced, since SRS items are generally not actually atomic, as far as our brains are concerned.

[Piotr Wozniak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zT8N3LTbePn2LVD7ZhJ5TLr) uses retrievability and stability in his analysis; [Robert A. Bjork](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zYPeHVeq311Jh4whSstyeFX) and Bjork (1992) call an analogous pair of parameters retrieval strength and storage strength, respectively.

Q. Express two-component memory model’s stability component analytically.

A. Stability is the time interval within which retrievability is above some threshold, e.g. 90%.
