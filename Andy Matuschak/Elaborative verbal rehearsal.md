# Elaborative verbal rehearsal
A reading comprehension strategy in which readers summarize a text and elaborate it by synthesizing, giving examples, and drawing personal connections. Effectively a highly specialized type of [[Self-explanation]]. The literature using this term seems to mostly dead-end in preference to Chi’s term, which also encompasses a wider range of behaviors.

Presumably this operationalizes some combination of:
- [[Retrieval practice]]
- [[Elaborative encoding]]
- [[Generation effect]]
- [[Self-explanation effect]]
