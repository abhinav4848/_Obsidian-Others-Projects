# Novices in enabling environments often can’t do what’s enabled

New participants in an [[Enabling environment]] may not immediately be able to do what it enables. The typical solution is an abstract introductory experience: explanatory guides, onboarding classes, background readings, etc. These supports can help new participants eventually access what an environment enables, but they’re not ideal: [[Enabling environments focus on doing what’s enabled]].

It’s often possible to improve an environment’s design to support more immediate participation (e.g. with [[Cognitive scaffolding]]). One powerful design approach: [Enacted experiences can bootstrap active participation in enabling environments](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zKubRcJXKjiCDPsPgJWckkP).

[[Situated learning]] (see in particular [[Situated Learning - Lave and Wenger]]) suggests that this problem can be overcome through _legitimate peripheral participation_: you can usually do _part_ of the thing, particularly if you’re sitting alongside an expert.
