# **How should note tagging practices change with ranked link visualization?**

In their indexes, Zettelkasten practitioners try to tag only the most important few notes for a given topic, then they rely on inter-note linkages to navigate from there (see [Indexed references vs. tags](Indexed%20references%20vs%20tags.md)). This keeps the entry high-signal (see [Tags are an ineffective association structure](Tags%20are%20an%20ineffective%20association%20structure.md)).

But this may just be a consequence of current interfaces for displaying tagged data. Conceptually, what’s happening here is that in the writer’s mind, many notes are tagged with a given tag, but some notes are particularly relevant to that tag, and the writer doesn’t want to lose track of those. So they create a *curated* representation of that tag to replace the system’s indifferent “list it all” visualization.

But if you could view a tag’s network structure, arranged by PageRank or something, I suspect this would be come much less important.
