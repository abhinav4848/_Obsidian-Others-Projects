# Taxonomy of note types
==TODO: flesh this out; write a note for each note type; etc==

For me, the practice of writing and revising notes is, at its core, about trying to move up the following rough ladder:

- Ephemeral scratchings in [[Daily working log]]
- Prompts and incomplete notes in writing inbox ([A writing inbox for transient and incomplete notes](A%20writing%20inbox%20for%20transient%20and%20incomplete%20notes.md)), which are meant to possibly become [Evergreen Notes](Evergreen%20Notes%208b05f5bf420f4caaad50f6fea2828638.md). These prompts may accumulate writing over time via spaced repetition (see [[Spaced repetition may be a helpful tool to incrementally develop inklings]])
- [Evergreen Notes](Evergreen%20Notes%208b05f5bf420f4caaad50f6fea2828638.md), in increasingly complex stages of development:
    - stubs implicitly defined through backlinks ([Backlinks can be used to implicitly define nodes in knowledge management systems](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zL9q21MA7ygsKVfvn6FwBMq)); e.g. [Note-writing system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zGKtrhpZ3hS8bw8UGL8hMTP), [Audiobooks](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zG91aqpyGEiy8McMHAW7juq)
    - simple definitions for terms of art, little of my own added; e.g. [Span of absolute judgment](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zMQK1sFXWbVMbSQAsjSTUvm), [[Spacing effect]]
    - [[Bridge notes narrowly relate two adjacent terms]] 
    - precise, narrow declarative notes ([[Prefer note titles with complete phrases to sharpen claims]]); e.g. [Human channel capacity increases with stimulus dimensionality](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z86ZRZ5s5ykUzGD8v8d33ro)
    - sometimes these are framed as questions, when evidence is too inconclusive to frame sharply; e.g. [[To what extent is exceptional ability heritable]]?, [To what extent can application prompts supplant recall prompts in the mnemonic medium?](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zMPNEnSC5ihp5MNMdxNJNdJ) 
    - higher-level APIs ([[Evergreen note titles are like APIs]])
    - notes abstracting over many other notes, e.g. [Educational games are a doomed approach to creating enabling environments](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zUVBJdPc4kBud5fsLmPFpbw), [[Reading texts on computers is unpleasant]]
    - personal terms of art, e.g. [Enacted experience](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z92TGMiBsnraf5KXxSTNkBJ)
- “Outline notes”, e.g. [§Enabling environments, games, and the Primer](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zGSGS1UHDogPKtvZB5hdT2A) 

Note types outside this ladder:
- Proper noun notes
    - “Literature notes”, titled after a single work and meant primarily as linkages to other more durable notes, and as targets for backlinks. I write these roughly as “outline notes,” except for someone else’s ideas. For example: [Miller - The magical number seven, plus or minus two](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zNCrrN6aGXeuiVXgnoiT7ND)
    - Likewise, but less commonly, I also have “person notes” (e.g. [Anand Agarawala](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zLXY8Ru3EzeKyjhqoYgCJD7)) and “business notes” (e.g. [Confluent](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zQ2vjssuHu3869yDHpTmYbm))
    - These note types are weakly evergreen. I may add to them over time, but because they aren’t concept-oriented ([Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented](Evergreen%20notes%20should%20be%20concept-oriented.md)), they’re not as useful to build on as an evergreen note. Non-trivial writing about proper nouns typically gets factored into separate evergreen notes which can be used in multiple places.
    - “Log” notes, which accumulate ephemeral observations about a specific practice, system, or project over time. They’re akin to a [Daily working log](Daily%20working%20log.md), but sliced by some topic of interest rather than by date. e.g. [Log: personal mnemonic medium](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zDuBTrCGDkf2J2TbtQwKDed)
    - With better transclusion or support for [Contextual backlinks](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zQtMfVrh8x4paaZv7MTp1Em), such notes could be written directly in one’s [Daily working log](Daily%20working%20log.md), and “log” notes could be defined as a query over such notes.

Tactically speaking, I usually denote a note’s “type” with a tag.

Don’t over-obsess or over-formalize this stuff. Remember: [Better note-taking misses the point; what matters is “better thinking”](Better%20note-taking%20misses%20the%20point;%20what%20matters%20is%20“better%20thinking”.md).
