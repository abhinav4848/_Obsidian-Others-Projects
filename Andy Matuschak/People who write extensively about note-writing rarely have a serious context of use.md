# **People who write extensively about note-writing rarely have a serious context of use**

Many bloggers and “life-hackers” have made a full-time job of suggesting how you should organize your journal, or how you should most effectively [Write about what you read to internalize texts deeply](Write%20about%20what%20you%20read%20to%20internalize%20texts%20deeply.md). We should take this advice seriously insofar as those practices have helped the authors achieve meaningful creative work: [Better note-taking misses the point; what matters is “better thinking”](Better%20note-taking%20misses%20the%20point;%20what%20matters%20is%20“better%20thinking”.md)

But most people who write about note-taking don’t seem particularly accomplished in their own fields, whatever those may be. In fact, most such writers aren’t applying their notes to some exogenous creative problem: their primary creative work *is* writing about productivity. These writers offer advice on note-taking to help scientists and executives with the challenges of their work, but the advice was developed in a context disconnected from those external realities. There are two related problems here: [Effective system design requires insights drawn from serious contexts of use](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7EQ2nVGus5B1rS9CqT18g6), and [Powerful enabling environments usually arise as a byproduct of projects pursuing their own intrinsically meaningful purposes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2huUCj3ko99HdzFcmEDfZD).

Luhmann, by contrast, barely wrote about his [Zettelkasten](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zDcuS8A5uxGR8hQygsqP83A): he focused on his prolific research output, then published a couple small essays about his practices near the end of his career.

I’m not quite guilty of this problem myself, but I certainly slip into this behavior for weeks at a time. This is a cautionary note.
