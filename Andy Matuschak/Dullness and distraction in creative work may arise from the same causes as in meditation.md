# **Dullness and distraction in creative work may arise from the same causes as in meditation**

It sounds obvious in retrospect:¬†Meditation¬†instructors say all the time that the point is not to achieve attention and awareness just while in explicit meditation sessions, but to bring that same quality of mind to everyday life. I‚Äôd understood that in terms of recognizing¬†[Impermanence](Impermanence.md)¬†and¬†[Non-identification](Non-identification.md). But somehow I hadn‚Äôt connected that to problems I encounter when doing difficult creative work.

When I‚Äôm doing some difficult design or research, it‚Äôs very common for me to struggle with feelings of tiredness. I think this is just¬†[Dullness](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zVNTDbWaVNxgTSPx3cNLDPc). And of course I often experience the progression of distraction -> forgetting -> mind-wandering, as described in¬†[Moments of consciousness model, after Culadasa](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zF3gSqhimNzCKYaWzm3rmUn).

These models help explain why I don‚Äôt wrestle with dullness or distraction/forgetting nearly as often when doing other activities. When I‚Äôm doing difficult creative work, I‚Äôm staring at the same object of attention for an extended period, just like in a meditation session; and just like the breath, the work rapidly ceases to produce novel stimuli. I‚Äôm staring at the same difficult paragraph I was staring at five minutes ago. And just as with the breath, when the object of attention is not generating many perceiving moments, the mind will naturally scan for other objects in awareness which might be more stimulating. Alternately (or additionally), the proportion of perceiving moments will simply drop, which in turn causes¬†[Dullness](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zVNTDbWaVNxgTSPx3cNLDPc).

The cure for these problems in creative work is the same as the cure for these problems in meditation:

- cultivating continuous introspective awareness (e.g. through setting intention to audit attention every few breaths)
- cultivating heightened sensitivity to the object of attention, intention to perceive ever greater level of detail
- increasing the proportion of perceiving moments to create more buffer against dullness, e.g. by expanding the scope of awareness

Of course, the kind of distraction I‚Äôm describing here is mostly internal‚Äîthe kind I generate for myself. Paul Graham¬†[points out](http://www.paulgraham.com/distraction.html)¬†that often, ‚Äúdistraction is not a static obstacle that you avoid like you might avoid a rock in the road. Distraction seeks you out.‚Äù

Q. In what sense do my meditation experiences explain my sleepiness-at-work experiences?

A. In both instances, you‚Äôre trying to maintain attention on a low-stimulation object; without training, the proportion of non-perceiving moments will climb.

Q. Why am I more likely to suffer from dullness and distraction when doing challenging creative work than in other activities?

A. When stuck on a creative problem, the object of attention isn‚Äôt naturally changing, so it generates increasingly subtle stimuli.
