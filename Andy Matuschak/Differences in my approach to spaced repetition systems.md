# Differences in my approach to spaced repetition systems
There are already many implementations of a [[Spaced repetition memory system]]. Why invest more effort here? Collecting notes on some of the key differences in my approach here to help key myself oriented toward high-order bits.

- [[Spaced repetition memory systems can be used to develop conceptual understanding]] (but existing systems and prior research focus almost exclusively on definitions or simple declarative facts)
- [[Writing good spaced repetition memory prompts is hard]]; this is a key blocker to useful widespread adoption. System designers mostly ignore this, but that’s like a publishing company ignoring the importance of sentences.
- [[Spaced repetition memory prompts alone are a poor communications medium]], but those problems may be solvable by embedding the mechanics in a richer context ([[The mnemonic medium gives structure to normally-atomized spaced repetition memory prompts]])
- I want to push spaced repetition systems to amplify the most meaningful things you do in life, contra [[The dominant culture around spaced repetition memory systems is fixated on meaningless goals]].
- I view spaced repetition as an instance of a broader category of systems: [[Spaced repetition systems can be used to program attention]]
    - see also [[Unusual applications of spaced repetition memory systems]]
