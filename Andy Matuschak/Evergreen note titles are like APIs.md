# Evergreen note titles are like APIs
When [Evergreen Notes](Evergreen%20Notes%208b05f5bf420f4caaad50f6fea2828638.md) are factored and titled well, those titles become an abstraction for the note itself. The entire note’s ideas can then be referenced using that handle (see [[Concept handles, after Alexander]]). In fact, this property itself functions as a kind of litmus: as you develop ideas in notes over time and improve the “APIs,” you’ll be able to write individual notes which abstract over increasingly large subtrees (e.g. [Enacted experiences have incredible potential as a mass medium](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z984ZZLbG4wREM6HAZAovMB) , [[Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work]]).

## Title of Atomic note
Title of Atomic note should be Clear, Concise, & Distinct (Atomic). The title for evergreen notes should be a clear title or statement. Formulating this one-liner clarifies and sharpens your thinking. And the hidden beauty is that this process naturally enforces an atomic note size—meaning "one note = one idea".

Try your best to have only one concept within a note. If a concept has multiple notes, that's fine.

## So how to write title **like APIs:**
Some effective note “API design” techniques: 
1. Separation of concerns ([[Evergreen notes should be atomic]]),
2. Sharp titles ([[Prefer note titles with complete phrases to sharpen claims]] - declarative statements or questions so you have to support/answer in the body),
3. Positive inflections/framings ([Prefer positive note titles to promote systematic theory](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z63PA5ATVi8oyhyLgeGvL3p)- to promote better idea linking and systematic theory)
