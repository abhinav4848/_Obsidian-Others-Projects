If a creative leap requires you to notice an unusual connection, coincidence, or contradiction in some stimulus, it’s often not good enough to be able to look up whatever you want. The critical creative insight is often equivalent to realizing that you _should_ look a particular thing up. Often that’s only possible if you already have the constituents of the connection available in long-term memory, and flexibly encoded enough that you can make the leap from whatever stimulus is before you to that past idea.

> Something I haven’t yet figured out is how to integrate Anki with note taking for my creative projects. I can’t replace note taking with Anki – it’s too slow, and for many things a poor use of my long-term memory. On the other hand, there are many benefits to using Anki for important items – fluid access to memory is at the foundation of so much creative thought.

> In practice, I find myself instinctively and unsystematically doing some things as notes, others as Anki questions, and still other things as both. Overall, it works okay, but my sense is that it could be a lot better if I applied more systematic thought and experimentation. Part of the problem is that I don’t have a very good system for note taking, period! If I worked more on that, I suspect the whole thing would get a lot better. Still, it works okay.
