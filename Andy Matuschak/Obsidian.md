# Obsidian
Highly extensible, closed-source [[Networked note-writing software]] based on [[Electron]].

Markdown is central to its conceptual model: all data is stored in Markdown plaintext; the editor puts Markdown front and center.

A recent “live editor” offers a hybrid experience: it mostly hides the Markdown syntax, but the syntax is “still there.” When your cursor is positioned in/near some relevant syntax, that syntax is displayed. And so “arrowing” around the document sometimes involves moving targets.

I like their philosophy and their commitment to open formats.

Obsidian Publish, one of their two paid products, is basically a commercial adaptation of my personal notes web site design. (There’s some acknowledgement of that [here](https://help.obsidian.md/User+interface/Use+tabs+in+Obsidian) #external , though narrowly scoped to the tab stacks. That’s fine).
