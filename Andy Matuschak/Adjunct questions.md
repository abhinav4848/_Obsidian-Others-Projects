# Adjunct questions
Questions inserted into a reading experience. These may be presented either before or after the content being tested. When placed after, these produce the [[Testing effect]] on the specific information being tested, as one would expect. But they also produce a more general effect: [[Adjunct questions improve comprehension of related but untested content]]. And there appear to be a [[Pre-testing effect]].
