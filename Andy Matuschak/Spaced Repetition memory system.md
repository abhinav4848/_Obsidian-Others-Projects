# Spaced Repetition memory system
A spaced-repetition memory system combines the [[Testing effect]] and the [[Spacing effect]]  to enable efficient memorization of many thousands of facts ([[Spaced repetition memory systems are extremely efficient]]). Some people also use them for a broader set of tasks (see below). [[Spaced repetition memory systems make memory a choice]], but they’re not just for rote facts: [[Spaced repetition memory systems can be used to develop conceptual understanding]].

The first consumer system of this kind was [[Supermemo]], created by [[Piotr Wozniak]]. It adopted and popularized the term “spaced repetition”; prior literature had used a variety of terms (often referring to more specific facets of the underlying phenomenon).

    - [[Memory augmentation can accelerate the unpleasant early stages of learning a subject]]
    - (caveat: it’s hard to write prompts for conceptual understanding!)
    - SRS are only for material you don’t care about enough to remember “naturally.” Better to “learn by doing.”
    - External memory aids are sufficient
    - Mnemonic techniques obviate SRS
    - Knowledge learned through SRS doesn’t transfer
    - The real value in SRS comes from making one’s own prompts
