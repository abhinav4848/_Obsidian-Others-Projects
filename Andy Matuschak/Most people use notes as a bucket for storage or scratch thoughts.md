# Most people use notes as a bucket for storage or scratch thoughts

People don‚Äôt want to forget an idea or a conversation or a task or quote from a book, so they write it down in Evernote or something. What‚Äôs the purpose? Probably: ‚ÄúTo make sure I don‚Äôt forget." Maybe: ‚ÄúJust writing it down helps me remember.‚Äù 

In this conception, notes are a way to [Close open loops](Close%20open%20loops.md), not to accumulate insight. The ‚Äúreal‚Äù work happens outside the notes; the notes are just a reference system which stores information which might help, or a write-once pile of ‚Äúmessy‚Äù thoughts (Khoe). 

These are not [Evergreen Notes](Evergreen%20Notes%208b05f5bf420f4caaad50f6fea2828638.md). Most ‚Äústorage-oriented‚Äù notes will never be useful again ([**Most people take only transient notes**](Most%20people%20take%20only%20transient%20notes.md)). More importantly, this framing misses that it‚Äôs possible for note-writing to be the ‚Äúreal‚Äù work ([Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work](Evergreen%20note-writing%20as%20fundamental%20unit%20of%20knowledge%20work.md)).
