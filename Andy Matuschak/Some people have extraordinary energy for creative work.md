# **Some people have extraordinary energy for creative work**

Contra [It’s hard to do difficult creative work for more than a few hours a day](It’s%20hard%20to%20do%20difficult%20creative%20work%20for%20more%20than%20a%20few%20hours%20a%20day.md):

From [Stephen Malina - Energetic Aliens](https://stephenmalina.com/post/2021-07-01-energetic-aliens-among-us/):

1. George Church
    - many key discoveries, founded many companies, many side projects
    - worked 100 hour weeks in the lab during grad school
    - forgets to eat for days if no one reminds him
2. Lee Hood
    - kept 18 hour workdays, starting each with running a few miles and doing 100 push-ups
    - did scientific reading until 11PM or midnight, then slept 4-6 hours
3. Napoleon
    - supposedly slept 4 hours per night, but one secretary suggests it was more like 7
    - verbally dictated dozens to hundreds of letters per day
    - “simultaneously an accomplished general, politician, lawmaker, and art critic”
4. Robert Moses
    - worked 12-14 hour days, including weekends
    - “Every morning there would be a manila envelope this thick, and six girls .would be working all day to do the things he had done overnight”
5. Grothendieck
    - spent 10-12 hours a day doing math at a blackboard
    - eventually burnt out, went ~crazy
6. Erdos
    - allegedly worked 19 hours a day, needed only 3 hours of sleep
    - used amphetamines (benzedrine, ritalin)
        - Upon succeeding at a challenge to avoid amphetamines for a month, Erdos told the friend who’d issued the challenge (from Daily Rituals): “You’ve shown me I’m not an addict. But I didn’t get any work done. I’d get up in the morning and stare at a blank piece of paper. I’d have no ideas, just like an ordinary person. You’ve set mathematics back a month.”
7. Donald Knuth
    - “Knuth seems to have been able to do very difficult cognitive work for many hours while chronically sleep deprived”
    - wrote an ALGOL compiler in a summer, including the manual in the last night
    - got a PhD at Caltech while employed at 40hr/wk!
        - (but got lucky in some sense by finding a solution to an open problem in just two hours)

    - Wrote from 7:30 AM to 10 PM.
9. Honore de Balzac

    - Consumed 50 cups of coffee per day (?!)

    - “I work, on average, 20 hours a day. Sometimes 22.”
11. John Carmack
