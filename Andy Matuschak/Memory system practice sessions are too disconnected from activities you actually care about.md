# Memory system practice sessions are too disconnected from activities you actually care about

[[Retrieval practice]] in a [[Spaced repetition memory system]] often feels so abstract: trying to remember a bunch of material from various books and papers you read in the past, all jumbled, in the form of questions you’ve answered before, in an artificial environment. Generously, perhaps, it’s a kind of [Deliberate practice, after Ericsson](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Deliberate_practice%2C_after_Ericsson) (no access), but it often feels like a chore in part because it’s not _doing the thing_, and the practice session’s emotional connection with _doing the thing_ is weak. 

Can we create something _like_ a retrieval practice session, but much more strongly grounded in what you actually care about? More clearly connected with your actual goals? Situated in the actual activity or context? Embedded in a social context? [[Think harder about sociality and memory systems]]
