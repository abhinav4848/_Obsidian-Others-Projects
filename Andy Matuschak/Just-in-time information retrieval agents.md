# Just-in-time information retrieval agents

This term describes agents which passively retrieve and display useful information based on a user’s action.

For example, the _Remembrance Agent_ is an Emacs extension which looks at the contents of the current document (near the cursor?) and finds associated documents, email messages, etc which are similar.

_Margin Notes_ is an agent which annotates web pages with links to personal files which may be relevant.
