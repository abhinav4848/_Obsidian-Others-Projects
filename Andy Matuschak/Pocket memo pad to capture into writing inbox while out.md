# Pocket memo pad to capture into writing inbox while out
I use a perforated A7 memo pad (Maruman Mnemosyne N193A) to take transient notes while I’m out. Striking ideas from conversations, ideas while walking, and so on all get captured here. I usually include a bit of context to help orient me later: a date, a place, a person, etc.

These notes don’t stay in the memo pad: it’s effectively an inbox which feeds [[A writing inbox for transient and incomplete notes]]. Intermittently, during [[My morning writing practice]], I process memo pad notes by developing them into [[Andy Matuschak/Evergreen Notes|Evergreen Notes]], by transferring them into my writing inbox, or by discarding them.

I tear off sheets as I process them, so I always know the notebook’s state: any non-blank pages still have to be processed.

Each idea gets its own tiny page. This helps me process them ([[Evergreen notes should be atomic]]): a good conversation might generate half a dozen memo pad pages, but each might require very different mental contexts to process.

I use this memo pad to help me [[Write about what you read to internalize texts deeply]]. While reading a book, I’ll capture notes about what I find interesting in the memo pad. Each idea gets one memo pad page, as before. I also include a page number and date.

The memo pad fits easily in my pocket, and vinyl cover is quite durable, so I carry one at all times, along with a pen.
