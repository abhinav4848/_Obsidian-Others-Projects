# **Pocket memo pad to capture into writing inbox while out**

I use a perforated A7 memo pad (Maruman Mnemosyne N193A) to take transient notes while I‚Äôm out. Striking ideas from conversations, ideas while walking, and so on all get captured here. I usually include a bit of context to help orient me later: a date, a place, a person, etc.

These notes don‚Äôt stay in the memo pad: it‚Äôs effectively an inbox which feeds¬†[A writing inbox for transient and incomplete notes](A%20writing%20inbox%20for%20transient%20and%20incomplete%20notes.md). Intermittently, during¬†[My morning writing practice](My%20morning%20writing%20practice.md), I process memo pad notes by developing them into¬†[Evergreen Notes](Evergreen%20Notes%208b05f5bf420f4caaad50f6fea2828638.md), by transferring them into my writing inbox, or by discarding them.

I tear off sheets as I process them, so I always know the notebook‚Äôs state: any non-blank pages still have to be processed.

Each idea gets its own tiny page. This helps me process them ([Evergreen notes should be atomic](Evergreen%20notes%20should%20be%20atomic.md)): a good conversation might generate half a dozen memo pad pages, but each might require very different mental contexts to process.

I use this memo pad to help me¬†[Write about what you read to internalize texts deeply](Write%20about%20what%20you%20read%20to%20internalize%20texts%20deeply.md). While reading a book, I‚Äôll capture notes about what I find interesting in the memo pad. Each idea gets one memo pad page, as before. I also include a page number and date.

The memo pad fits easily in my pocket, and vinyl cover is quite durable, so I carry one at all times, along with a pen.
