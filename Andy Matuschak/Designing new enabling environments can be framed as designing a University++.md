# Designing new enabling environments can be framed as designing a University++
Universities have historically been effective examples of an [[Enabling environment]] (along some axes, and with some significant limitations):

- The best ones are centered around professors’ research, rather than instruction ([[Powerful enabling environments usually arise as a byproduct of projects pursuing their own intrinsically meaningful purposes]]; [[Powerful enabling environments focus on expert use]])
- Students at the best universities actually advance their field, rather than just learning facts. ([[Enabling environments focus on doing what’s enabled]])
- Universities use rituals, culture, structured timelines, titles, and physical space to (weakly) create an [[Enacted experience]], demonstrating [[Enacted experiences can bootstrap active participation in enabling environments]].

Contemporary enabling environments like [[Y Combinator]] have already replaced elements of the university. It’s interesting to consider designing novel enabling environments with this purpose specifically in mind; e.g.:

- to expand the amount of original research participants (including expert participants) can do
- to do a better job than the university at connecting to meaning ([[Transcendental narrative]]; [[Enabling environments’ activities directly serve an intrinsically meaningful purpose]])
- to more effectively bootstrap novices into doing ([[Novices in enabling environments often can’t do what’s enabled]])
- to scale more effectively ([[Enacted experiences have incredible potential as a mass medium]])

MOOCs were a failed attempt in this direction. A related useful framing, then, is “What do MOOCs really want to be?”
