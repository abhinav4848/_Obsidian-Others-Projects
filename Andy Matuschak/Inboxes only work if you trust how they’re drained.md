# **Inboxes only work if you trust how they’re drained**

Reliable inboxes are powerful because they let us [Close open loops](Close%20open%20loops.md) and focus on the work itself, rather than on meta-work.

But this story seems to recur constantly:

1. You set up a new to-do list. Everything seems so promising!
2. You add stuff to it and check things off. Time passes.
3. Something comes up, and you hesitate before adding it to your to-do list: it might get lost, and you need to make sure it gets done.
4. So you make a sticky note for this special to-do, outside of your to-do list.
5. The sticky notes multiply. Now you have a new to-do list!
6. Repeat.

Inboxes only let us [Close open loops](Close%20open%20loops.md) if they’re reliable—that is, if you can add something to it with total confidence that it’ll get “handled” in some reasonable timeframe. “Handled” is fuzzy: you just need to feel that the fate of those items roughly reflects your true preferences. You’ll trust an inbox system which ends up dropping 90% of items if the other 10% were the only ones you really cared about. You won’t trust an inbox system in which 90% of tasks get done, but the 10% which don’t get done are the ones you really cared about.

In efficient inboxes, it may be easy to maintain this kind of confidence: the departure naturally rate exceeds the arrival rate. But most knowledge worker inboxes don’t look like this. The rates are highly variable, which creates bottlenecks. Not every item actually *needs* to get handled, but people are over-optimistic, so items accrue in a backlog.

Sometimes we can decrease the arrival rate; see e.g. [Beware automatic import into the reading inbox](Beware%20automatic%20import%20into%20the%20reading%20inbox.md). Usually we must also increase the departure rate, which is hard; see e.g. [Triage strategies for maintaining inboxes (e.g. Inbox Zero) are often too brittle](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2Pg1CbUyvjV4jEoqmr8Xua).
