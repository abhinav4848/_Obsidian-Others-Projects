# **People seem to forget most of what they read, and they mostly don‚Äôt notice**

It seems that most people can remember only a few high-level details of a book weeks later‚Äîif that. A typical reader might spend hours finishing some serious non-fiction‚Äîthen maybe it comes up at a dinner party, and they find you can remember like three sentences. Basically no detailed recall. Barely the gist!

What‚Äôs more: people seem surprised when this happens. They seem to consistently overestimate how much they‚Äôre absorbing from a book.

Part of the problem here is¬†[People often struggle to remember details of prose text because they never processed them in the first place](People%20often%20struggle%20to%20remember%20details%20of%20prose%20text%20because%20they%20never%20processed%20them%20in%20the%20first%20place.md).

See¬†[How rapidly do people forget practical knowledge?](How%20rapidly%20do%20people%20forget%20practical%20knowledge.md)

This observation is unfortunate for many reasons, but among them:¬†[Deep understanding requires detailed knowledge of fundamentals](Deep%20understanding%20requires%20detailed%20knowledge%20of%20fundamentals.md)¬†and¬†[Complex ideas may be hard to learn in part because their components overflow working memory](Complex%20ideas%20may%20be%20hard%20to%20learn%20in%20part%20because%20their%20components%20overflow%20working%20memory.md).

For common objections:¬†[Many people view memory as unimportant to deep creative work](Many%20people%20view%20memory%20as%20unimportant%20to%20deep%20creative%20work.md).

    - In a limited experimental setting, grad students are given an expository passage; they read once, twice, or three times; delayed (one week) free recall scores at 27% (main idea) and 16% (details) after one reading; cued recall scores at 57% and 64% respectively. Re-reading helps a bit in the cued setting, but not much in for freed recall.
