# **Write about what you read to internalize texts deeply**

If you want to deeply internalize something you’re reading, the best way I know is to write about it:

- because [Understanding requires effortful engagement](Understanding%20requires%20effortful%20engagement.md)
    - and in particular, [Writing forces sharper understanding](Writing%20forces%20sharper%20understanding.md)
    - remember: [Collecting material feels more useful than it usually is](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zQm6XAB3XXrXLHzF7gahpJ2) 
- because otherwise you won’t [[Do your own thinking]]
- because [[Knowledge work should accrete]] and [[Evergreen note-writing helps reading efforts accumulate]]
- indeed: **[[Most people read ineffectively]]** 

For deep understanding, it’s not enough to just highlight or write marginalia in books: there isn’t much pressure to synthesize, connect, or to get to the heart of things. And they don’t add up to anything over time as you read more. Instead, write [Evergreen Notes](Evergreen%20Notes%208b05f5bf420f4caaad50f6fea2828638.md) as you read.

But of course, it doesn’t always make sense to read in this way: much of the time you’re not really trying to internalize the text deeply, and text may not be worthy of that much attention: [The best way to read is highly contextual](The%20best%20way%20to%20read%20is%20highly%20contextual.md).

Also, it’s worth noting: [The most effective readers and thinkers I know don’t take notes when reading](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z12PGwFx275xTmGHazNgQbn). Speaking at least for myself, experience has suggested that I need more support to effectively engage with what I’m reading.

# Method

Our broad approach is an alternating cycle:

1. **Collect** passages that seem interesting and thoughts that emerge while reading: [How to collect observations while reading](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zME6gV6mc1mQ2KDE5acyho8)
2. **Process** clusters of those passages and thoughts into lasting notes: [How to process reading annotations into evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zEr7kCcH6zUUroDJBwDj2n5)
