> For your question about my quantum computing class, I would say that I found the essays were the most helpful in having me remember specific aspects of circuits and operations done on them. So, for example, the definitions of the various Pauli gates (X, Y, and Z), as well as other gates like the Hadamard were definitely engraved into my mind after each review session! I don’t know if this particularly helped for problem sets (we didn’t have exams), but I’d say it helped in the sense that I didn’t ever feel stuck on these “small” hurdles. Have you ever had the feeling where you want to get X done, but X is so big so you actually have to do little steps y and z beforehand? They might not be difficult on their own, but you can burn a lot of time/mental effort having to go over y and z again before finally getting to X. I found Quantum Country gave me a good sense of these smaller fundamentals so that they never became issues when working with the material. (Of course, I also enjoyed the writing a lot!)
