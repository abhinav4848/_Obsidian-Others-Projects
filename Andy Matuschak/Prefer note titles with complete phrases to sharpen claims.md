# Prefer note titles with complete phrases to sharpen claims
When writing [[Andy Matuschak/Evergreen Notes|Evergreen Notes]], I’ve found that using complete phrases as note titles helps maintain concept-orientation ([[Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented]]). For example: [[Educational objectives often subvert themselves]], [[Evergreen notes permit smooth incremental progress in writing (“incremental writing”)]].

These are often declarative or imperative phrases making a strong claim. This puts pressure on me to adequately support the claim in the body. If I write a note but struggle to summarize it in a sharp title, that’s often a sign that my thinking is muddy or that this note is about several topics (contra [[Evergreen notes should be atomic]]). In both cases, the solution is to break the ideas down and write about the bits I understand best first.

Questions also make good note titles because that position creates pressure to make the question get to the core of the matter. Some questions really are evergreen ([[To what extent is exceptional ability heritable]]?); others are more ephemeral creative prompts ([[How might the mnemonic medium enable readers in genres outside platform knowledge]]?). The goal with the latter type of note is to eventually drop the question mark, refactoring it into declarative/imperative notes.

A few common exceptions to this policy:
- I use nouns and noun phrases in note titles only to define core terms (which other notes generally orbit around). Examples: [[Executable strategy]], [[Enacted experience]], [[Enabling environment]]
- Outline notes (see [[Create speculative outlines while you write]]) like [[§Note-writing systems]]
- For more, see [[Taxonomy of note types]]

I often begin by writing a note without knowing what the title will be. The title often emerges from the text as it’s written. When a note suggests a strong title with a clear claim, that’s a good sign that it’s starting to make sense. Related: [[Evergreen note titles are like APIs]]
