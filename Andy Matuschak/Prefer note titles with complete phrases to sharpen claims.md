# **Prefer note titles with complete phrases to sharpen claims**

When writing [Evergreen Notes](Evergreen%20Notes%208b05f5bf420f4caaad50f6fea2828638.md), I’ve found that using complete phrases as note titles helps maintain concept-orientation ([Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented](Evergreen%20notes%20should%20be%20concept-oriented.md)). For example: [Educational objectives often subvert themselves](Educational%20objectives%20often%20subvert%20themselves.md), [Evergreen notes permit smooth incremental progress in writing (“incremental writing”)](Evergreen%20notes%20permit%20smooth%20incremental%20progress%20in%20writing%20(“incremental%20writing”).md).

These are often declarative or imperative phrases making a strong claim. This puts pressure on me to adequately support the claim in the body. If I write a note but struggle to summarize it in a sharp title, that’s often a sign that my thinking is muddy or that this note is about several topics (contra [Evergreen notes should be atomic](Evergreen%20notes%20should%20be%20atomic.md)). In both cases, the solution is to break the ideas down and write about the bits I understand best first.

Questions also make good note titles because that position creates pressure to make the question get to the core of the matter. Some questions really are evergreen ([To what extent is exceptional ability heritable?](To%20what%20extent%20is%20exceptional%20ability%20heritable.md)); others are more ephemeral creative prompts ([How might the mnemonic medium enable readers in genres outside platform knowledge?](How%20might%20the%20mnemonic%20medium%20enable%20readers%20in%20genres%20outside%20platform%20knowledge.md)). The goal with the latter type of note is to eventually drop the question mark, refactoring it into declarative/imperative notes.

A few common exceptions to this policy:

- I use nouns and noun phrases in note titles only to define core terms (which other notes generally orbit around). Examples: [Executable strategy](Executable%20strategy.md), [Enacted experience](Enacted%20experience.md), [Enabling environment](Enabling%20environment.md)
- Outline notes (see [Create speculative outlines while you write](Create%20speculative%20outlines%20while%20you%20write.md)) like [§Note-writing systems](§Note-writing%20systems.md)
- For more, see [[Taxonomy of note types]]

I often begin by writing a note without knowing what the title will be. The title often emerges from the text as it’s written. When a note suggests a strong title with a clear claim, that’s a good sign that it’s starting to make sense.
