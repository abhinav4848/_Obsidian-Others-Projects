# Mnemonic texts could be serialized in small sections over time, timed to reader recall

One early theory in our design of the [[Mnemonic medium]] was that if someone reviews chapter 1’s content a few times, they may have an easier time understanding chapter 2: [[Complex ideas may be hard to learn in part because their components overflow working memory]].

If one took that idea seriously:

1. One might author later chapters not as free-standing texts but as focused additions to prior chapters, assuming that the reader had thoroughly learned that material.
2. One might write smaller chapters to keep working memory from overflowing; one might use chapter boundaries as “checkpoints” before building something new on that prior material.
3. One might suggest when readers should continue to the next chapter, either passively in a chapter listing or proactively with a notification. One might even gate access to later chapters on progress through its prerequisite chapters.
4. One might incorporate the extended calendar schedule into one’s writing: if you know that the reader won’t reach chapter 5 until two months after chapter 1, that may significantly change the relationship authors develop with readers in their prose. ([[Mass mediums mostly lack an authored time dimension beyond a day]])

[[Execute Program]] implements the first three of these notions, and it certainly creates quite a curated-feeling experience: 
1. [Execute Program’s lessons assume solid recall of prior material](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zH26uarYCm9y6tqzuxaGUzt)
2. [Execute Program’s lessons are quite short](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zLnMMGiCT6xDjMfMurTzKjs)
3. [Execute Program’s lessons don’t unlock until you’ve successfully reviewed their prerequisites](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zHLWyC5LVXZLWE9RmoC1gua)

This is one possible instantiation of [[The mnemonic medium can be adapted to author an experience which unfolds over time]], a kind of [[Timeful text]].

This relates to [[Incremental reading]], but with the author exerting somewhat more control over the session composition.
