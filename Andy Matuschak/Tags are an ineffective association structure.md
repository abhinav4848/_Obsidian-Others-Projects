# **Tags are an ineffective association structure**

Tags are an easy way to relate heterogenous items, but they‚Äôre quite a low-signal way of describing relationships.

All items with a given tag are presented as being related‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs hard to see how. They‚Äôre just a jumbled, unordered list.

Some of those items are more relevant to a particular tag‚Äôs topic than others, so we should¬†[Prefer explicit associations to inferred associations](Prefer%20explicit%20associations%20to%20inferred%20associations.md).

Some of those items have only a few sentences touching on a tag, but the tag is associated with the whole item. We should¬†[Prefer fine-grained associations](Prefer%20fine-grained%20associations.md). Relatedly, tags are often pretty vague or broad. Better to link to associate ideas more precisely.

And sometimes, it would be very helpful to have a few words of context about¬†*why*¬†an item relates to a particular tag. We should¬†[Prefer labeled associations](Prefer%20labeled%20associations.md).
