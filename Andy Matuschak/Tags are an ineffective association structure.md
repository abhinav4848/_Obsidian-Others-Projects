# **Tags are an ineffective association structure**

Tags are an easy way to relate heterogenous items, but they’re quite a low-signal way of describing relationships.

All items with a given tag are presented as being related… but it’s hard to see how. They’re just a jumbled, unordered list.

Some of those items are more relevant to a particular tag’s topic than others, so we should [[Prefer explicit associations to inferred associations]].

Some of those items have only a few sentences touching on a tag, but the tag is associated with the whole item. We should [Prefer fine-grained associations](Prefer%20fine-grained%20associations.md). Relatedly, tags are often pretty vague or broad. Better to link to associate ideas more precisely.

And sometimes, it would be very helpful to have a few words of context about *why* an item relates to a particular tag. We should [Prefer labeled associations](Prefer%20labeled%20associations.md).
