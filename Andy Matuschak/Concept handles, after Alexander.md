A “concept handle” is a memorable noun phrase representing a complex, often abstract topic. For example: “prisoner’s dilemma,” “Overton window,” “belief in belief,” etc. In my own writing, examples include [Enabling environment](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z492hGrHvRvJiEY9UfB4Mby), [Enacted experience](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z92TGMiBsnraf5KXxSTNkBJ), etc. The “concept handle” is a concept handle for itself, coined by [Scott Alexander](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z9hfoSKuG9186kjhyQVZYdf).

Successful concept handles can really amplify a vague idea which many people sort of understand but can’t point to and talk about. If you give that vague notion a crisp, catchy name, you can unlock a lot of conversation and reflection. Per Alexander:

> I’m not too likely to discover some entirely new social phenomenon that nobody’s ever thought about before. But there are a lot of things people have vague nebulous ideas about that they can’t quite put into words. Changing those into crystal-clear ([Link](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/15/can-it-be-wrong-to-crystallize-patterns/)) ideas they can manipulate and discuss with others is a big deal.

One way to think about concept handles is as “APIs for concepts.” In this sense, the idea connects to my thinking about [Evergreen note titles are like APIs](Evergreen%20note%20titles%20are%20like%20APIs.md).
