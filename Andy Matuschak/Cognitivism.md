# Cognitivism
Cognitivism is a theoretical framework for understanding the mind. It models the mind as an information processor acting on mental representations according to algorithms. This is the theoretical basis of¬†[[Cognitive psychology]].

Cognitivism was formed as part of¬†[The cognitive revolution](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zQ7SznVVFocQtB24Db6feG8). Cognitivists believe that reinforcement informs mental representations but doesn‚Äôt compel behavior. We make decisions and inferences through theories and expectations, not simple associations with past experiences.

## Cognitivism on behaviorist data
- Learning-performance distinction: not everything learned is immediately manifest in behavior (Ebbinghaus‚Äôs data shows this!)
    - Implies there can be representations of knowledge in the mind even if it isn‚Äôt represented in behavior.
- Expectancy hypothesis: behavior depends on a person‚Äôs expectations for a situation, not just on what‚Äôs reinforced
    - e.g. Estes (1969) gave college students a test where they had to predict the values of different kinds of cards, and they would often choose the theoretically-highest-reward type of cards even when the experiment was manipulated so that they were never rewarded for that behavior.
- Hypotheses and rule learning: people learn rules by evaluating hypotheses, not just through reinforcement
    - e.g. Levine (1971) asked students to learn rules about geometric shapes and found that students more readily learned the complex rules, irrespective of how much the simple rules were reinforced.
    - Behaviorism struggles here because the student the subject should form simple paired association in the case of the simple rules.
    - He suggested this was because students formed and tested hypotheses about these complex rules (but not the simple ones).
