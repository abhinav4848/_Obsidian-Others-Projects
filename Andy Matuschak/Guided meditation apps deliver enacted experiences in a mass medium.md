# Guided meditation apps deliver enacted experiences in a mass medium

If you download a [[Guided meditation app]] and stick with its daily sessions for a few months, you’ll likely have some surprising and profound experiences. Unlike a typical course, though, any profound discoveries you experience will feel largely self-authored, despite the presence of a teacher. You’re not going to learn by waiting for the Meditation teacher to “make you enlightened”: you have to put in the time on the cushion, receptive to your own sensations. All that said, while these experiences might feel self-authored, meditation lessons are in fact structured to bring them about. This makes meditation lessons an interesting example of an [[Enacted experience]].

In general, [[Enacted experiences are hard to distribute]]. But these meditation apps scale beautifully: they’re a mass medium. They represent a promising reference for [[Enacted experiences have incredible potential as a mass medium]].

- Meditation is a [[Participatory environment]]—indeed it, requires intentional participation
- The lessons are framed as clearly subservient to the practice: [[Guided meditation apps bundle instruction with daily sessions ]]
